INTRODUCTION.

_I. The Time Period._

The time-period covered in this sixth volume of the HISTORY OF THE
CHURCH is less than one year. Nine months and twenty-eight days, to be
exact; or from the 1st of September, 1843, to the 29th of June, 1844.
Events within this period are therefore given in elaborate detail. The
general reader and the student of our history will find in this volume
a larger collection of documents, official and otherwise, covering this
period, than will be found elsewhere.

This volume also closes the first Period of our Church History,
the period marked off by two events: (1) the birth of the Prophet
Joseph Smith; and (2) his martyrdom and that of his brother Hyrum, at
Carthage, Illinois.

The Journal History of the Prophet, that great source of historical
knowledge concerning the development of the New Dispensation, closes
with his entry of the 22nd of June, 1844. After that, for our knowledge
of the remaining events of the Prophet's life, we are dependent upon
collections of _data_ by the Church historians from public and private
sources, of which collections there are two: the first extends from
the 22nd of June to the 29th of that month, and forms the concluding
chapters of this volume; the second begins also with the 22nd of June,
and extends to the 8th of August, 1844; at which time the Twelve
Apostles were sustained for the time being as the presiding council of
the Church. This second collection of _data_ by the Church historians
will open Volume VII of this History.

In the present volume we see the Prophet's brave struggle against the
overwhelming odds of his foes--foes within the Church, false brethren;
and foes without the Church--the combination of political and sectarian
enemies fixed in their determination to kill him, destroy Nauvoo, and
expel the Saints from Illinois: for all these things were included in
the program of the anti-Mormons of Illinois, even before the death
of the Prophet was encompassed. Three score and seven years now give
perspective to the stirring events in which the really great drama was
enacted; and from that vantage ground of perspective said events may
be reviewed to the enlightenment of those who seek to know the truth,
{XXII} and the injustice of the things enacted in Illinois during the
closing months of the Prophet Joseph's earthly career.

_II. Why the Latter-day Saints were Welcomed to Illinois._

On the one hand, in the above mentioned struggle, was a people who but
a few years before had been welcomed into Illinois as exiles from a
neighboring state, the victims of a cruel and ignorant intolerance.
They were welcomed, in part, because of the injustice to which they
had been subjected in a neighboring state, and because their physical
sufferings, arising from want of shelter and food in an inclement
season of the year to which they were exposed, was such as to move
adamantine hearts to pity. Also they were welcomed because, as pointed
out in the Introduction to Volume IV of this HISTORY, the state of
Illinois needed augmentation of her population by just such a people
as the Latter-day Saints were--industrious, frugal, skilled mechanics,
successful farmers, experienced men of affairs, men capable of trade
and commerce, enterprising and with a larger proportion of educated
men and women among them than was to be found among the people of
western Illinois in those days. I do not here employ the language of
adulation on the one hand, nor seek to make invidious distinctions upon
the other. Either would be vain, since the well-known and accepted
facts of history would disprove the declarations made if not founded
in truth. The fact is, however, that all that is claimed above for
the Missouri exiled Latter-day Saints is true and well-attested by
their achievements in settling Nauvoo, which in four years rose from
a ware-house or two and a few half tumbledown shacks on the banks of
the river, and called "Commerce," to the dignity of being the first
city in Illinois in population and commercial enterprise, and also gave
promise of developing into a manufacturing center of great importance.
This last item was evidenced in the fact that the founder of Nauvoo,
President Joseph Smith, and the Nauvoo city council appreciated the
possibilities in the water power of the Lower Des Moines Rapids in
the Mississippi, at the head of which the city was located. Reference
to his journal entry for the 23rd of September (this volume, p. 80)
will witness that he suggested that a petition be sent to the national
Congress for the construction of a canal around the rapids to overcome
the obstruction for the free passage of river craft, which the rapids
prevented during the low water period of each year, and thus enhance
the value of the great stream to the inland commerce of the west. [1]
Reference again to President Smith's journal {XXIII} entry for the 8th
of December, 1843 (this volume, p. 103) will disclose the fact that he
gave instruction in the forenoon to his clerk to draw a plan for a dam
in the Mississippi; and that in the afternoon of the same day the city
council met and passed an ordinance authorizing Joseph Smith to "erect
a dam of suitable height to propel mills and machinery from any point
within the limits of said city, and below the Nauvoo House;" also in
connection with this dam to construct a "harbor or basin for steamboats
and other craft;" and to construct docks, wharfs and landings," the
wharfage fees to be "regulated by ordinance of said city (this volume
p. 106).

_III. Nauvoo as a Possible Manufacturing Center._

What further contributed to the promise that Nauvoo would be a great
manufacturing center as well as the center of an immense agricultural
region with a splendid commercial outlet, was the fact that artisans
and tradesmen of the very first order in skill, were rapidly gathering
into the city, not only from the New England and other Eastern states
of our own country, but also from the British Isles. It was inevitable
if let alone that Nauvoo would become the greatest manufacturing
center of Illinois, and among the first of such cities in the United
States. The Prophet did not live to see even a commencement made upon
these large enterprises he had conceived, but subsequently his zealous
followers organized a company to carry them to a successful conclusion
under the title of "The Nauvoo Water Power Company," [2] which began
the construction of the dam on the 29th of April, 1845; but which had
to be abandoned because of the hostilities that soon after increased
and continued until they culminated in the expulsion of the Latter-day
Saints from Illinois. [3]

{XXIV} In addition to these measures, manufacturing and agricultural
associations were incorporated; also the "Nauvoo House Associations"
for the erection of a hotel, ambitious to be known as the finest
hostelry in the Upper Mississippi country. One of the agricultural
associations, known as the "Big Field Corporation," held six sections,
or three thousand eight hundred and forty acres of land east of Nauvoo;
and the year following the Prophet's death the company harvested about
thirty thousand bushels of corn, nearly the same amount of wheat,
besides an "abundance of oats, barley, buckwheat, potatoes and other
vegetables." [4]

_IV. Educational Measures at Nauvoo._

And not only in material things was the superior character of
Nauvoo's founders and builders proclaimed; but equally broad and
comprehensive were their preparations for an educational system. By
their city charter they were empowered to establish an institution of
learning within the limits of the city for the teaching of the arts
and sciences and learned professions, to be called the "University
of the City of Nauvoo;" also a common school system for the city,
all of which was in course of development even in the early years
of Nauvoo's existence. And in addition to these direct educational
institutions of common schools and projected university, literary
and dramatic associations were organized, as also choral and band
organizations for the cultivation of musical talents and to promote the
pleasure and refinement of society; while the religious zeal of the
community expressed itself in the rapidly rising walls of the splendid
temple--soon to be the most solid and pretentious building in the
state; and in the tireless missionary enterprise of the dominant Church.

{XXV} _V. Jealousy of Nauvoo's Promising Greatness._

Nothing was lacking, then, in the promises of constant and rapid
growth, of prosperity and future greatness of Nauvoo. Small wonder
if the narrow bigotry and jealousy of small-souled men of the time
and vicinity--especially those who were inhabitants of rival towns,
particularly those of Warsaw and Carthage--were envious of Nauvoo's
prosperity and promise of future greatness. Hitherto this element of
jealousy of Nauvoo's prosperity and promise of future greatness has
not been accorded the importance due to it as a contributing cause to
the warfare made upon that city and the Saints. Little doubt, however,
can be entertained, now attention has been called to it, but what as a
contributing cause jealousy of Nauvoo stood next to religious prejudice
and political distrust and hatred.

A correspondent from Fair Haven, Connecticut, to a gentleman in Nauvoo,
set forth this matter most convincingly. An excerpt of the letter was
published in the _Nauvoo Neighbor_ of August 7th, 1844. It is proper to
say that the writer was not a member of the Mormon Church; "but," as
the editor of the _Neighbor_ describes him, "a citizen of Connecticut,
loving law and liberty and life;" and now the paragraph dealing with
the point under discussion:

    "It is now known here that the lazy speculators of Warsaw, and the
    still lazier office drones at Carthage, cared nothing for Joseph
    Smith personally, or for his tenets either; but the prosperity
    of Nauvoo increasing as it did, beyond any former parallel, even
    in the western world, excited in their bosoms envy, hatred and
    all ungodliness. This is the true secret of all their barbarous
    movements against Mormonism--and they supposed by destroying
    the Smiths they should extinguish their religion, disperse the
    Mormons--depopulating and desolating Nauvoo."

Also a correspondent to the _State Register_ published at Springfield,
Illinois, speaking of Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the _Warsaw Signal_
and the anti-Mormon disturbances in Hancock county said:

    "He [Sharp] is also described as having made himself the 'organ
    of a gang of town lot speculators at Warsaw,' who are afraid that
    Nauvoo is about to kill off their town and render speculation
    abortive." [5]

Mr. Backenstos in January, 1845, when the repeal of the Nauvoo Charter
was under discussion in the Illinois legislature, referred to this same
subject in a speech on the floor of the house of representatives, in
the course of which he said:

    "Town rivalry had also something to do with this opposition to
    Nauvoo. While Warsaw was on the decline, Nauvoo was rapidly
    increasing {XXVI} in wealth and population; a plan to bring about
    a re-action was soon concocted by the leading men of Warsaw,
    who made one pilgrimage after another to Nauvoo, imploring the
    Mormon Prophet to aid them in building up a city adjoining the
    town of Warsaw, by settling a portion of the Mormon population in
    and about Warsaw, and commence the building of a new city. The
    bubble soon exploded, and the speculation failed. This gave rise
    to dissatisfaction with some who had heretofore been exceedingly
    polite to '_Lieutenant General Joseph Smith!_'" [6]

Thus in every way, to refer back to the point of starting the
discussion of this subdivision, the Latter-day Saints are proven
by their achievements and the foundations they laid for the future
greatness of their city, to be a superior people, and hence a desirable
addition to the population of the then young commonwealth of Illinois.

_VI. The Character of the People of Western Illinois._

On the other hand there was a population in western Illinois, and
perhaps more especially in Hancock county, which had more than its
full share of lawless and desperate men; who, as by a law of social
gravitation, seek the frontiers of civilization. Moreover it is
notorious that the whole upper Mississippi was a rendezvous for
gamblers, counterfeiters, horse thieves, murderers and other criminals
that infested the great river, which gave easy ingress and egress to a
frontier wilderness on the one hand, and to such centers of population
and activity, on the other, as New Orleans, St. Louis, and many minor
places, besides. "I must give some account of the anti-Mormons,"
says Governor Ford in his History of Illinois, when referring to the
inhabitants of Hancock county. "I had a good opportunity to know the
settlers of Hancock county," he continues. "I had attended the circuit
courts there as state's attorney, from 1830, when the county was first
organized, up to 1834: and to my certain knowledge the early settlers,
with some honorable exceptions, were in popular languages hard cases"
(page 406). Then for a period of several years to the advent of the
"Mormons" he had no means of knowing the character of the people who
drifted into the country: "But," he adds, "having passed my whole
life on the frontier, on the outer edge of the settlements, I have
frequently seen that a few first settlers would fix the character of a
settlement for good or for bad, for many years after its commencement.
If bad men began the settlement, bad men would be attracted to them,
upon the well known principle that birds of a feather will flock
together. Rogues will find each other out, and so will honest men.
From all which it appears extremely probable, that the later {XXVII}
immigrants were many of them attracted to Hancock by a secret sympathy
between them and the early settlers."

Indeed the governor suggests that it may have been "the promptings of
a secret instinct," which led the "Mormons" to "discern their fellows"
and induced them to settle in Hancock in preference to other localities
open to them. All which may be regarded as an ingenious thrust at the
Latter-day Saints, but which fails of reaching its mark from the fact
that it was the criminal element chiefly in Hancock county's population
which arrayed itself in antagonism against the Saints, and against
whom they were arrayed in all their conflicts in that county. Whereas,
under the governor's theory, this criminal element among the "old
citizens" and the Saints should have been as hand in glove in their
cooperation of encompassing evil things. But to the contrary; from the
time the "Mormons" appeared on the scenes at Commerce, in 1839, until
they were expelled, they steadfastly and emphatically set their faces
against the evils that cursed that community, and denounced all manner
of evil both as manifested in a few of their own delinquent members,
apostates and camp followers who trailed after the main body of the
Church from Missouri, as well as in others: such as dram-drinking,
swearing, Sabbath-breaking, contracting debts under pretense of poverty
and distress without any prospects or intention of paying, [7] and
especially did they denounce stealing, under any and all pretexts
whatsoever. [8]

And as it was largely the criminal element among the "old citizens"
that was arrayed against the Saints (with unprincipled politicians
and a few bigoted and jealous religious leaders added), so was it the
conservative and law-abiding portion of the community among whom they
had many friends; and nearly all of whom were at least so far friendly
with the Saints that they could not be induced to oppose them, much
less join in acts of mob violence to the injury of their persons or
property; for which reason this portion of the non-Mormon population
were called by the contemptuous name of "Jack-Mormons," which epithet
was invented by the editor of the Warsaw _Signal,_ Thomas C. Sharp,
who also originated the term "Jack-Mason" when editing an anti-Masonic
paper in western New York. In all probability it was this second name
which suggested the first.

{XXVIII} _VII. Educational Status of the People of Western Illinois._

Education among the masses of Hancock's non-Mormon population was of
the meagrest kind. Even Mr. Gregg, the historian of the county, who
always gives the best report possible of conditions, remarks, when
treating of the county's educational status, that "a new country
and among pioneers, is not the place where prosperous colleges and
seminaries, or even high schools, are actually found. Hence common
schools and, in many instances, very 'common' ones at that, were the
best means of education in Hancock county in early days," But this is
said of the schools of Hancock county; the greater number of the adult
population, 1839-1846, which represent the years when the Saints lived
in the county, had migrated from states where educational opportunities
were even fewer and less advanced than in western Illinois. Even
some of the men prominent in political life in the state were men
of extremely limited education. "Joseph Duncan, elected governor of
Illinois in 1834, and who had served four terms in Congress previous
to his election as governor, had but a limited education," says Gregg.
[9] And of Thomas Carlin, who was the governor of Illinois when the
exiled Saints moved into the state--he had previously held many minor
offices--the same authority says: "He had but a meager education." [10]

But while the above represents the educational conditions both among
the masses of Hancock county and western Illinois in general, and of
some of the men in public life, it is also true that there were here
and there men in Hancock and surrounding counties of good education and
enlightened culture, such as Stephen A. Douglas, O. H. Browning, Major
Warren, John J. Hardin, General Minor R. Deming, Samuel Marshal, Judge
Jesse B. Thomas, Josiah Lamborn, Governor Ford and others.

_VIII. The Political Phase._

It has already been observed in these volumes (Vol. IV, Introduction)
that in addition to the Latter-day Saints being welcomed into Illinois
on account of their economic value in a newly and sparsely settled
country, as wealth creators through their industry, frugality and skill
in mechanics and husbandry, political parties of Illinois both Whigs
and Democrats vied with each other in heartiness of welcome, each
hoping the profit by the influx of the new population in both state
{XXIX} and national elections. Hence it was possible to obtain for
Nauvoo the exceptional powers that constituted her, under the letter
of her charter, an autonomy within the limits of her boundaries more
akin to a sovereign state than to a municipality within a state and a
county. And such were the powers claimed for her by her founders. [11]
Hence also that catering to the misconception and wrong interpretations
of the chartered powers of Nauvoo by lawyers and politicians seeking
professional and political favors of the people, which encouraged the
belief that the city government was the omnipotent political power
within the city limits; and that her municipal court was not only equal
to, but even superior to the state courts--"for all other courts were
restricted," it was contended, while the municipal court of Nauvoo
was not restricted! Similar claims of absolutism were made respecting
Nauvoo misled by their legal and political advisers, who gave false
counsel instead of true, and who encouraged people in their prejudices
and flattered their vanity rather than corrected their errors by an
appeal to sound judgment and to the law.

_IX. Mischief Arising from False Legal and Political Counsel._

Much mischief arose from this source. It was because of these
misconceptions in respect of the character of their city government
that led to the enactment of those ill advised and unwarranted city
ordinances--

That made gold and silver alone legal tender within the city;

That declared Joseph Smith exempt from arrest on requisitions from
Missouri founded upon the old difficulties in that state, and providing
that persons making an attempt to arrest him might be taken with or
without process, imprisoned for life, and might not be pardoned by the
governor without consent of the mayor; [12]

That authorized the city council, marshal, constables and city watch
to require all strangers entering the city or already tarrying there
to give their names, former residence and for what intent they were
tarrying in the city, and answer such other questions as the officers
respectively deemed proper to ask; refusal to give the desired
information, or giving false names or information subjected them to the
same penalties as "vagrants and disorderly persons;"

That further authorized and required the above named officers to {XXX}
"hail and take all persons found strolling about the city at night
after nine o'clock and before sunrise, and to confine them in ward for
trial under the ordinances concerning vagrants and disorderly persons,
unless they could give a good account of themselves for being out
after nine o'clock;"

That further authorized and required the aforesaid officers to
enter all hotels or houses of public entertainment, and such other
habitations as they may judge proper, and require the inmates to
give immediate information of all persons residing in said hotel or
habitation, and their business, occupation or movements, under penalty
of forfeiture of license, if a public house, and they and the transient
persons subject to the penalties visited upon vagrants for failure
to give the information required, or giving false information; while
the officer who should "refuse or neglect to perform the above duties
should be fined $100, and be broke of his office;"

That forbade the search and seizure of person or property by foreign
process [_i. e._ other process than that issuing from the city's
authority] within the city of Nauvoo, leading to the widespread belief
that the design of said ordinance was "to hinder the execution of the
statutes of Illinois" within said city; [13]

That asked the general government to ratify the Nauvoo Charter, and
in addition constitute the city a territorial government, by granting
"all rights, powers, privileges and immunities belonging to territories
and not repugnant to the constitution of the United States," with
power granted to the mayor to call to his aid a sufficient number
of the United States troops, in connection with the Nauvoo Legion,
to repel the invasion of mobs, keep the public peace, protect the
innocent from lawless banditti; the United States officers to obey the
requisition of this ordinance; and the Nauvoo Legion, when in service
quelling mobs and preserving the public peace, to be under the same
regulations, rules and laws of pay as the troops of the United States;
the territorial privileges to continue until the "state of Missouri
restores to those exiled citizens [the Latter-day Saints] the lands,
rights, privileges, property, and damages for all losses" they had
sustained by being banished from that commonwealth; [14]

And, finally, that asserted the right of the municipal court to arrest
{XXXI} process issued by the state's circuit courts, and even by the
United States courts, by _habeas corpus_ proceedings; and insisted,
not only upon the right to pass judgment upon the sufficiency of writs
under which arrests were made, but upon the right also to go behind the
writs and try the cases upon their merits.

_X. Subserviency of Politicians and Lawyers._

Blame for this political subserviency and misleading political and
legal advice, may not be charged on one party more than another. If
Cyrus Walker, a Whig candidate for congress, assented to the doctrine
as understood by Nauvoo's leading men, that the municipal court of
Nauvoo held the power under _habeas corpus_ procedure to arrest
execution of process of the state courts, as he did, [15] so, too,
did Joseph P. Hoge, Democratic nominee; and even Governor Ford, when
requested to call out the militia to rearrest Joseph Smith after he had
been liberated from the custody of Sheriff Reynolds, agent of Missouri,
under _habeas corpus_ proceedings, took refuge behind the _habeas
corpus_ proceedings of the Municipal Court at Nauvoo. In that case the
court not only inquired into the sufficiency of the writ of requisition
from Missouri, and granted by Governor Ford himself, but also went back
of the writ and tried the case _exparte_ on its merits, and finally
discharged the prisoner, both "for want of substance in the warrant, *
* * as well as upon the merits of the case." [16] When answering the
request of Missouri to rearrest Joseph Smith, Governor Ford, I say, at
least took refuge behind the aforesaid proceedings of the Municipal
Court to the extent of saying, in the face of that procedure, that
"no process, officer or authority of Illinois had been resisted or
interfered with," [17] and therefore refused to call out the militia to
rearrest President Smith.

It is but fair to Governor Ford, however, to say that in his inaugural
speech of December 8th, 1842, he pointed out what he regarded as
objectionable features in the Nauvoo charter, and recommended its
modification, [18] and later censured the lawyers for misleading the
Nauvoo city authorities in this matter, in the following passage from
a letter to the Mayor and City Council of Nauvoo, under date of June
22nd, 1844.

    You have also assumed to yourselves more power than you are
    entitled to in relation to_ habeas corpus_ under your charter. I
    know that you have been told by lawyers, for the purpose of gaining
    your favor, {XXXII} that you have this power to any extent. In this
    they have deceived you for their own base purposes. Your charter
    supposes that you may pass ordinances, a breach of which will
    result in the imprisonment of the offender.

    For the purpose of giving more speedy relief to such persons
    authority was given to the Municipal Court to issue writs of
    _habeas corpus_ in all cases arising under the ordinances of the
    city.

    It was never supposed by the Legislature, nor can the language of
    your charter be tortured to mean that a jurisdiction was intended
    to be conferred which would apply to all cases of imprisonment
    under the general laws of the state or of the United States, as
    well as the city ordinances.

To which President Smith replied:

    Whatever power we have exercised in the _habeas corpus_ has been
    done in accordance with the letter of the Charter and Constitution
    as we confidently understood them; and that, too, with the ablest
    counsel; but if it be so that we have erred in this thing, let the
    Supreme Court correct the evil. We have never gone contrary to
    constitutional law, so far as we have been able to learn it. If
    lawyers have belied their profession to abuse us the evil be on
    their heads. [19]

_XI. The Fate of a Balance of Power Factor in Politics._

Being misled by false legal and political advice was not the only
misfortune of the kind perpetrated upon the Saints, first by the
subserviency of, and then the betrayal by, politicians and lawyers.
The hope of both parties to secure political advantage by the influx
of the now Latter-day Saint population into the state has been already
referred to; as also the efforts of both parties to gain their favor by
granting exceptional favors to them in founding Nauvoo. When, however,
the time for voting came, and the Saints voted according to their
convictions of duty, or as their inclinations prompted, the defeated
party or candidates blamed them for the defeat, and straightway favored
the adoption of an anti-Mormon policy, which found support not only in
the defeated party, but also among those who felt a grievance against
the Saints on other accounts; some because Nauvoo's prosperity and
constantly increasing importance as a center of population and trade
and commerce was rapidly eclipsing all other towns of the state; and
others, over-anxious to retard, if not destroy, a rival system on
account of religious prejudice. When an anti-Mormon party took the
field, pledged itself to repeal the Nauvoo charter, and to drive the
Mormons from the state--as was the pledge of Joseph Duncan, Whig
candidate for Governor of Illinois in 1841, [20] there was really no
other course for the Saints to pursue but to combine solidly for the
defeat of the candidate and {XXXIII} party making such pledges; the
instinct of self-preservation impelled such a course, rather than the
prompting of inclination.

For a time, as in all such cases, the party receiving the support of
this practically solid Mormon vote could be relied upon to protect
and defend those who had made success possible for them; but at the
first indication that the hold of the favored party upon such vote is
precarious, that there is a possibility that it might go to the other
side, [21] naturally the ardor of their friendship, seldom or never
sincere, cools; and they are as ready to combine for the destruction
of their former allies as others have been. And when in addition to
precariousness of hold upon those who possess the balance of power
there stands up in the back ground of things the possibility that
the balance of power party may become strong enough in the political
subdivision in which they are located to run affairs on their own
account, the likelihood of all parties combining against them becomes
all the more assured. In Illinois the Latter-day Saints ran the entire
political gamut of experience as a "balance of power" factor in the
politics of western Illinois. The final phase of that experience had
been reached when at a mass meeting held at Carthage on the sixth of
September, 1843, it was--

    _Resolved,_ That as it has been too common for several years past
    for politicians of both political parties, not only of this county,
    but likewise of the state, to go to Nauvoo and truckle to the heads
    of the Mormon clan for their influence, we pledge ourselves that we
    will not support any man of either party in the future who shall
    thus debase himself. [22]

Politicians still sought Mormon aid to encompass their own political
ends, but, as Governor Ford later remarked, "they were willing and
anxious for Mormon voters at elections, but they were unwilling to risk
their popularity with the people, by taking part in their favor even
when law and justice, and the Constitution, were all on their side;"
[23] and {XXXIV} so finally all parties turned against them, and they
were at the last, as we shall see in the future volume of this history,
expelled without mercy from the state.

_XII. Joseph Smith's Candidacy for the Presidency._

The mischief that threatened during the Prophet's life time, and
which finally befell the Saints, was clearly foreseen by the Church
leaders; and the desire to escape from the threatening portents of it
prompted the nomination of Joseph Smith for the office of President of
the United States, in the general election of 1844. Of course there
could be no hope seriously entertained that he would be elected; but,
as explained by an editorial in the _Times and Seasons,_ [24] if the
Saints could not succeed in electing their candidate, they would have
the satisfaction of knowing that they had acted conscientiously; they
had used their best judgment, under the circumstances, and if they
had to throw away their votes, it was better to do so upon a worthy
than upon an unworthy individual who might use the weapon they put
into his hand to destroy them. The Prophet himself evidently regarded
his nomination humorously rather than seriously, except that it might
result in withdrawing the Saints from the position of shuttle-cock
between the battle doors of the two old political parties. "I care but
little about the presidential chair," he said on one occasion. "I would
not give half as much for the office of President of the United States
as I would for the one I now hold as Lieutenant General of the Nauvoo
Legion." Again he said: "When I get hold of eastern papers, and see
how popular I am; I am afraid myself that I shall be elected; but if
I should be, I would not say [_i. e._ to the Latter-day Saints] your
cause is just but I can do nothing for you."

As a further evidence that Joseph Smith did not regard his candidacy
as likely to be successful, he was, at the time of his nomination and
afterwards, pushing vigorously his project of a western movement for
the Church. He had drawn up a memorial and ordinance to the national
congress asking to be authorized by the general government to raise
one hundred thousand armed volunteers to police the intermountain and
Pacific coast west from Oregon to Texas, for the purpose of assuring
Texas her independence, and maintaining the claims of the United
States to Oregon, and affording the whole western population of our
country protection from Indian depredations; and thus contribute to
the rapid settlement and development of that noble extent of country
lying between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean. His agents, Orson
Hyde and Orson Pratt, presented the matter to senators {XXXV} and
representatives at Washington, and a number favored the project of the
removal of the Mormons to the west, but generally urged that Joseph
Smith go without seeking special authorization from the government.
Reference to Orson Hyde's report of the procedure among congressmen
and their views upon the subject will be found in his two important
communications to the Prophet from Washington, in chapter XVI of this
volume. Mr. John Wentworth, representative to Congress from northern
Illinois, introduced President Smith's Memorial and Ordinance into
the House on the 25th of May, to be read for the information of the
House; but before the reading was concluded, objection was made, and
as it required unanimous consent to have it read, further reading was
prevented. A vote to suspend the rules in order that Mr. Wentworth
might secure the reading of the memorial stood 79 yeas, and 86 nays,
which vote gives evidence at least of a widespread desire to have the
matter presented to the House. [25]

_XIII. Missouri as a Factor in the Affairs of Nauvoo._

In addition to all the Illinois factors that entered into the complex
situation confronting the Saints at Nauvoo, at the time of the
Prophet's death, and some time previous to his arrest, was the attitude
and course pursued by Missouri with reference to Nauvoo and the Saints.
Disgraced as a state by her own conduct towards the Latter-day Saints,
when they were inhabitants within her borders, her people were all too
willing to co-operate with any party or agency that would continue to
make war upon them. If the state of Illinois which with open arms had
received the people that Missouri exiled from her borders, under such
circumstances of cruelty, could also be brought to drive them from that
state, it would be regarded, in a way, as a vindication of Missouri
and the course she had taken in her treatment of the Saints, since in
effect it would say, that the people of Illinois, no less than the
people of Missouri, found it impossible to tolerate the "Mormons;"
and therefore there must be something fundamentally wrong with them,
rather than with the people of these states. Hence the anti-Mormons of
Hancock and adjoining counties in Illinois, always found support in
whatever of violence or wrong they planned against the Saints. Hence
the constant threats of invasion of mobs from Missouri, emphasized by
occasional kidnapping expeditions into Hancock county, together with
frequent requisitions upon the Illinois authorities for the arrest and
extradition of Joseph Smith on the old charges against him in Missouri.
And these {XXXVI} Missouri threats and outrages were not among the
least of the annoyances and anxieties of the Saints; and they make
clear the necessity that was felt for an efficient militia force at
Nauvoo. Hence the Nauvoo Legion and the lively interest manifested in
its frequent musters and drills, and its thorough equipment; all of
which, but for the constant danger of invasion from Missouri mobs,
and the co-operation with them of like forces in Illinois, would have
been inconsistent with the deportment of a religious community whose
mission was one of peace and good will towards men; and who had been
especially commanded to "renounce war and proclaim peace" (Doc and Cov.
Sec. 98:16); and commanded also to "sue for peace," both to those who
had "smitten" them--the revelation was given after the expulsion from
Jackson county, Missouri--and "to all people;" and "lift up an ensign
of peace, and make a proclamation of peace unto the ends of the earth"
(Doc. and Cov. sec 105: 38-40). But invasions from Missouri constantly
menacing them, and the danger of mob violence breaking out in Illinois,
justified the organization of the Legion, and the maintenance of its
efficiency by full equipment of arms and frequent drills and musters;
for the right of self-preservation is not abrogated by any divine law
given to the Saints; and duty to protect home and family against the
assaults of the evil-disposed, presses as firmly upon the Saints, as
upon those who have not definitely pledged themselves to a program of
righteousness.

_XIV. Apostate Conspirators at Nauvoo._

One other factor only remains to be mentioned of those that enter into
that combination of forces that resulted in the death of the Prophet
and the Patriarch. That is the conspiracy of apostates within Nauvoo
itself.

The apostates and their sympathizers were headed by a coterie of
prominent young men: The two Law brothers, William and Wilson; Robert
D. and Charles A. Foster, brothers; Francis M. and Chauncey L. Higbee,
brothers, and unworthy sons of that most faithful man and the Prophet's
devoted friend, Judge Elias Higbee (See Vol. IV pp. 81-100 _passim_);
Sylvester Emmons and Joseph H. Jackson. Of these, William Law was
counselor in the First Presidency, and Wilson Law was a major general,
and commander of one of the cohorts of the Nauvoo Legion, and all were
or had been more or less prominent in the public life of Nauvoo.

The cause of their apostasy seems to have been the baneful influence
of John C. Bennett's immoralities; for these men were quite generally
associates of his before his flight from Nauvoo. They evidently lost
{XXXVII} the spirit of the gospel, wandered through sin into spiritual
darkness, and seemingly were obsessed by a murderous spirit against the
Prophet who boldly revealed their wickedness and publicly denounced
their conduct; and in retaliation this coterie of apostates entered
into conspiracies to encompass President Smith's death, and that of his
brother Hyrum. They were in communication with the Prophet's enemies in
Missouri, and sought to betray him into their hands. They were among
the chief actors in all schemes of opposition and conspiracies against
him in the closing year of his life, including those plots which
eventuated in the martyrdom of both Prophet and Patriarch at Carthage.

_XV. The "Expositor" Affair._

Such are the chief factors that enter into the combination of events
detailed in this volume of HISTORY and which have a direct relationship
to the martyrdom of the Smith brothers. They existed as combustible
materials awaiting only the spark that would set them aflame to work
death and destruction.

The spark came. It came in the destruction of the _Nauvoo Expositor,_
published by the above mentioned coterie of apostates. It was the
intention of the _Expositor,_ as its name would indicate, to make
an _expose_ of alleged conditions in Nauvoo, in the moral, social,
religious and political phase of them. Also to agitate for the
_"unconditional repeal of the Nauvoo Charter."_ This was a challenge
to mortal combat, the issue being the life of the city of Nauvoo; and
after that the question of the existence of the Church in Illinois,
or even within the confines of the United States; for undoubtedly the
city charter once repealed, carrying with it the disorganization of the
Legion, protection for the Saints, as matters stood in 1844, both civil
and military, would be gone. It was a life and death struggle then
that the advent of the _Expositor_ inaugurated. The Saints stood at
such disadvantage in the proposed contest that if the _Expositor_ was
allowed to run its course it would inevitably have won its case against
the city; and against the Church, so far as the latter continuing in
Illinois, and perhaps as far as its continuance in the United States
was concerned.

The new marriage system, involving the practice, within certain
limitations and under very special conditions, of a plurality of wives,
constituted a ground of appeal to popular prejudices and passions that
would have been absolutely resistless if the paper had been allowed
to proceed. The charter would have been repealed; the city government
destroyed, or at the least modified and placed in the hands of an
apostate or anti-Mormon minority whose administration would have been
intolerable to the large majority of Nauvoo's citizens; and finally the
{XXXVIII} scenes of Missouri would have been re-enacted in an Illinois
setting.

In the presence of such difficulties, what was to be done? In addition
to declaring the existence of the practice of plural marriage, not yet
announced or publicly taught as a doctrine of the Church, and agitating
for the unqualified repeal of the Nauvoo charter, gross immoralities
were charged against leading citizens which doubtless rendered the
paper grossly libelous. In other cities such an avowed enemy as the
_Expositor_ was, would have been destroyed by a mob. For the people
of Nauvoo to have so proceeded would have been a departure from their
principles of upholding law and order, and would have brought upon
them the people of the surrounding counties, and from Missouri in
overwhelming numbers. Mob violence could not be thought of; and yet the
safety of the community imperatively demanded the suppression of the
_Expositor_ at any cost.

Under these circumstances the city council met and took under
consideration the _Expositor_ and the necessity of destroying it. As
their charter conferred upon the city the right to remove nuisances,
the city council declared the _Expositor_ press a nuisance and directed
the Mayor to have it destroyed, which he did by giving an order to that
effect, and it was destroyed without riot or tumult.

The legality of the action of the Mayor and City Council was, of
course, questionable, though some sought to defend it on legal grounds;
but it must be conceded that neither proof nor argument for legality
are convincing. On the grounds of expediency or necessity the action
is more defensible. The existence of the city, the preservation of
the Latter-day Saints until provision could be made for a retreat
from Illinois--which retreat was even then being provided for by the
Prophet in the projected movement of the Church to the west--demanded
the cessation of the publication of the _Expositor_. By proceeding at
least under the forms of law, the city council, though they might be
conscious of the illegality of their action, avoided the necessity of
the people resorting to mob action for self-preservation, and made
it possible for the legality of their course to be determined in the
courts, and the parties injured to recover compensation for the press
and damages by civil process. Meantime the libelous press with its
mission of destruction of the Saints at Nauvoo was silenced; and had
events taken the course which the action of the city council provided,
a respite would have been gained from impending violence, during which
arrangements for the retreat of the Saints from Illinois could have
been completed and a goal of safety won for them. Under a plea, then,
of absolute necessity to self-preservation of a community, and to
achieve the retreat here alluded to, and with the certainty that those
injured in property by the _Expositor's_ destruction would be fully
compensated {XXXIX} in civil action before the courts--the action of
the mayor and city council of Nauvoo is defensible, even if not on the
ground of the legality of their procedure. [26]

_XVI. The Appeal to the Mob Spirit._

Events did not take the course planned for them. The uproar that
followed the destruction of the _Expositor_ press, put all reason at
defiance. At Warsaw a mass meeting was held which issued a statement,
in connection with the resolutions it passed, that "A mob at Nauvoo,
under a city ordinance, has violated the highest privilege in
government; and to seek redress in the ordinary way would be utterly
ineffectual. * * * _Resolved,_ that we hold ourselves at all times
in readiness to co-operate with our fellow citizens in this state,
Missouri, and Iowa, to exterminate, _utterly exterminate_ the wicked
and abominable Mormon leaders, the authors of our troubles. * * * The
time, in our opinion, has arrived when the adherents of Smith as a body
should be driven from the surrounding settlements into Nauvoo. That the
Prophet and his miscreant adherents should then be demanded at their
hands; and, if not surrendered, a war of extermination should be waged
to the entire destruction, if necessary for our protection, of his
adherents. And we hereby recommend this resolution to the consideration
of the several townships, to the mass convention to be held at
Carthage."

The Carthage meeting held a few days later embodied the above in their
resolutions, as did other mass meetings held at various places. The
_Warsaw Signal_ in its impression of June 12th, passionately said: [27]

    "We have only to state that this [i. e. The destruction of the
    _Expositor_ press] is sufficient! War and extermination is
    inevitable! CITIZENS ARISE, ONE and ALL!!! Can you stand by, and
    suffer such INFERNAL DEVILS! to ROB men of their property rights,
    without avenging them? We have no time to comment: every man will
    make his own. LET IT BE MADE WITH POWDER and BALL!!!"

All the combustible material to which attention is called in this
Introduction was instantly aflame at the destruction of the _Expositor_
press. Every passion was appealed to, jealousy, envy, cupidity, hatred.
All the lawless elements of the community were practically invited to
{XL} assemble and run riot in lawless violence, and excess of carnage
and destruction of property and life. Nothing but the wholesome fear of
the strength and effectiveness of the Nauvoo Legion at that time held
this lawless element in check.

It was all in vain that hearings were had before the municipal court of
Nauvoo, on the _Expositor_ matter; in vain that a subsequent hearing
was had before Esquire Wells, then not a Mormon and living outside of
Nauvoo limits; in vain that the _Nauvoo Neighbor_ sought to conciliate
the awakening wrath that was aroused in the community, by pleading
that if the city council had "exceeded the law of the land, a higher
court could regulate the proceedings;" in vain that President Smith
urged Governor Ford to come to Nauvoo to make personal investigation of
conditions and take the necessary steps to prevent riot and war--all
was in vain; preparations were in the making on all sides for an
uprising against Nauvoo and the Saints, and there was nothing left but
to defend the city by placing it under martial law and calling upon the
Legion to resist the threatened assault, which act was made the basis
for the subsequent charge of "treason."

Then followed in quick succession the demand of the governor for the
Mayor and members of the City Council to come to Carthage and submit to
trial under circumstances that inevitably meant death; the inspiration
of the Prophet to go to the West and all would be well; the crossing
of the Mississippi by the Prophet and a few trusted friends to make
preparations for that journey; the accusation by false friends of
cowardice on the Prophet's part, the flight as of a false shepherd
leaving the flock to be devoured by wolves; the lightning-like retort
of the Prophet--"_If my life is of no value to my friends, it is
of none to myself;"_ the return to Nauvoo; the subsequent going to
Carthage to submit to the demands of the governor of Illinois in every
particular, and the well-known story of Carthage jail--the martyrdom.

_XVII. The Prophet's Nobility in the hour of Trial._

The bearing of the Prophet throughout the closing months with which
this volume deals is admirable. There is no faltering or evidence of
weakness at any point of his conduct. If criticized at all it would be
for over-daring, for over self-confidence, that approached sublimity.
Strong men through wickedness fell away from their discipleship, and
conspired against him; the Prophet reproved them in the gate, and
proclaimed their iniquities in public when hope of reforming them
was gone. He saw mobs forming for the destruction of himself and
Nauvoo and his people; he calmly prepared to meet force with force,
and drilled and prepared his legion for the conflict, entrenched
some of the approaches to the city, and picketed them with guards;
as mayor of the {XLI} city he placed the city under martial law; and
as lieutenant-general he took personal command of the Nauvoo Legion
and stood ready to defend the rights of himself and his people, for
which his revolutionary ancestry had fought in the war for American
independence. He believed gloriously in the right of self-defense, and
resistance to oppression by physical force if necessary. To his uncle
John Smith at Ramus who had asked for counsel in the disturbed state of
things, he wrote ten days before his death:

    "I write these few lines to inform you that we feel determined in
    this place not to be dismayed if hell boils over all at once. We
    feel to hope for the best, and determined to prepare for the worst,
    and we want this to be your motto in common with us: _We will never
    ground our arms until we give them up by death._"

And from Carthage prison, on the morning of the day of his martyrdom,
he wrote to his wife for transmission to his people:

    "There is one principle which is eternal: It is the duty of all men
    to protect their lives and the lives of their household, whenever
    necessity requires, and no power has a right to forbid it, should
    the last extreme arrive; but I anticipate no such extreme; _but
    caution is the parent of safety._"

When the jail in Carthage was assailed, and the mob was pouring
murderous volleys into the room occupied by himself and friends, the
Prophet turned prom the prostrate form of his murdered brother to face
death-dealing guns and bravely returned the fire of his assailants,
"bringing his man down every time," and compelling even John Hay, who
but reluctantly accords the Prophet any quality of virtue, to confess
that he "made a handsome fight" in the jail. [28]

_XVIII. Always the Prophet-Teacher._

But what was more wonderful than the manifestation of moral and
physical courage and good generalship during these turbulent months of
his career, was the pursuance of his duties as a teacher of religious
truth--his calling as a Prophet of God. Notwithstanding he was troubled
on every side, he could compose his mind to instruct the {XLII} Church
on such doctrines as the complete salvation of their dead; how to
proceed with the administration of all ordinances given for and in
behalf of the dead; the doctrine of the resurrection and the reality
of spiritual existences; the plurality of Divine Intelligences, or
Gods; the nature of man's spirit; the doctrine of eternal progress for
intelligences who keep the estates through which they are appointed to
pass; the nature and character of the Godhead, and the relationship
of man to God. All these themes and many more he dwelt upon in
public discourse and private interview and written communications.
He lived his life, as I have said elsewhere, _in crescendo,_ it grew
in intensity and volume as he approached its close. Higher and still
higher the inspiration of God directed his thoughts; bolder were
his conceptions, and clearer his expositions of them. So far was he
from being a "fallen prophet" in the closing months of his career,
as apostates charged, that he grew stronger with each passing day;
more impressive in weight of personal character, and charm of manner;
for he preserved amid all the conflicts and trials through which he
passed--until the shadows of impending death began to fall upon him
in Carthage prison--the natural sweetness of his nature, and the
intellectual playfulness characteristic of him from boyhood--_so do not
fallen prophets._

* * * * * * *

Side by side on the banks of the majestic river that half encircles
Nauvoo, the "beautiful," carrying with it also the idea of "rest,"
peacefully sleep the brothers, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the Prophet and
the Patriarch of the Church in the New Dispensation of the Gospel.
Their lives were interlaced by almost daily associations from childhood
to the last awful scene of martyrdom. It was therefore most fitting
that they should be buried beside each other, on the banks of the
"Father of Waters" in the city they had founded, where they had toiled
and suffered and achieved; where their joys rose to greater heights
and their sorrows sounded greater depths than falls to the lot of but
few men in this world. Undisturbed may their death slumber be until it
shall be ended by the trump of God, calling them forth to a glorious
resurrection.

* * * * * * *

_Prophet and Patriarch_

In the Temple square at Salt Lake City, where tens of thousands, made
up of people of nearly every nation in the world view them, stand two
bronze statues, life size, on granite bases. They are the statues
of the Brothers Smith, the Prophet and the Patriarch of the New
Dispensation of the Gospel. On the granite basements, respectively, are
bronze tablets on {XLIII} which is engraved the Life Record of these
men, and what is characteristic of each.

The text of the bronze plate of Hyrum Smith's statue is as follows:

    HYRUM SMITH.

    The Patriarch and a witness of the Book of Mormon.

    An elder brother, and the steadfast friend and counselor of Joseph
    Smith, the Prophet.

    Born at Tunbridge, Vermont, February 9th, 1800; suffered martyrdom
    with the Prophet at Carthage, Illinois, on the 27th of June, 1844.

    The friendship of the brothers Hyrum and Joseph Smith is foremost
    among the few great friendships of the world's history. Their names
    will be classed among the martyrs for religion.

    The Book of Mormon--the plates of which Hyrum Smith both saw and
    handled; the revelations in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; the
    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--these, to bring them
    forth for the salvation of the world, cost the best blood of the
    19th century.

    "I could pray in my heart that all men were like my brother Hyrum,
    who possesses the mildness of a lamb and the integrity of Job, and,
    in short, the meekness and humility of Christ. I love him with that
    love that is stronger than death."--_Joseph Smith_.

    "If ever there was an exemplary, honest and virtuous man, the
    embodiment of all that is noble in the human form, Hyrum Smith was
    the representative."--_President John Taylor_.

    As he shared in the labors, so does he share in the honor and glory
    of the New Dispensation with his Prophet Brother.

    In life they were not divided; in death they were not separated; in
    glory they are one.

The text on the west side of the base of Joseph Smith's tablet is:

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    The Prophet of the New Dispensation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
    our Lord. He was born at Sharon, Vermont, on the 23rd of December,
    1805; and suffered Martyrdom for the word of God and the testimony
    of Jesus at Carthage, Illinois, on the 27th of June, 1844.

    HIS VISION OF GOD.

    I saw two Personages whose glory and brightness defy all
    description. One of them spake unto me and said:

    "_This is my Beloved Son: hear Him._"

    I asked which of all the sects was right, and which I should join.
    I {XLIV} was answered I must join none of them; they were all
    wrong; they teach for doctrine the commandments of men; I received
    a promise that the fullness of the Gospel would at some future time
    be made known to me.

    THE BOOK OF MORMON.

    This book was revealed to him, and he translated it by the gift and
    power of God. It is an inspired history of ancient America, and
    contains the fullness of the Gospel. It is the American Testament
    of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

    THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH.

    Joseph Smith received divine authority through the ministration of
    angels to teach the Gospel and administer the ordinances thereof.
    He established again in the earth the Church of Jesus Christ,
    organizing it by the will and commandment of God on the 6th day of
    April, 1830.

    He also received commission to gather Israel and establish Zion on
    this land of America; to erect temples and perform all ordinances
    therein both for the living and the dead; and prepare the way for
    the glorious coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to reign on earth.

The contents of the tablet on the east side of the base of the
Prophet's statue are these gems from his teachings:

    TRUTH GEMS.

    The glory of God is intelligence.

    It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.

    Whatever principles of intelligence we attain unto in this life
    will rise with us in the resurrection.

    There is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations
    of this world upon which all blessings are predicated; and when
    we obtain any blessing from God it is by obedience to that law on
    which it is predicated.

    This is the work and glory of God: to bring to pass the immortality
    and eternal life of man.

    Adam fell that man might be; and men are that they might have joy.

    The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have
    an end. Jesus was in the beginning with the Father: man was also in
    the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was
    not created or made, neither indeed can be.

    The spirit and body is the soul of man; and the resurrection from
    the dead is the redemption of the soul.

    It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the
    character of God; and to know that man, (as Moses) may converse
    with Him as one man converses with another.

{XLV} This message of the Prophet, and these doctrines of the east
bronze tablet, together with other doctrines taught by him in this
PERIOD I of our CHURCH HISTORY, and to be found scattered through the
six volumes now published of that history, await only the mind of
some God-inspired Spencer to cast them into synthetical form--to be
adequately presented and witnessed--to constitute Mormonism both the
Religion and the Philosophy of modern times--to bring to pass and to
glorify the Golden Age of the long-promised Millennium of Christian
hope.

1. That the general government of the United states has since
constructed such a canal from Keokuk to Montrose, directly opposite
Nauvoo on the west, and at a cost of more than four and a half million
dollars, completing it in 1877 is noted in this volume, p. 80 and
footnote.

2. See _Nauvoo Neighbor_ for March 5th and March 12th. John E. Page
was president of the company; and in a communication to the _Neighbor_
(March 12, 1845) urging a vigorous prosecution of the enterprise, he
said:

"We have commenced active operations for the building of a dam in the
river, as noticed in the _Neighbor_ of last week. * * *

"Here is the proud and gallant Mississippi, with her rapid current,
tumbling to the broad Atlantic, seeming to say (as she quickens her
pace over the rugged rocks of the lower rapids just opposite to our
beautiful Nauvoo) only improve my shores and banks, ye Saints, as ye
improve my neighboring soil; and I will propel your mills, cotton and
woollen manufactories, by which your laborers can find employ, and your
poor can be clothed and fed."

3. As the suggestion of Joseph Smith for building the canal around the
Des Moines Rapids by the general government of the United states was
carried out; so also is the water power of the Des Moines Rapids being
utilized for manufacturing and other purposes, first suggested by the
Prophet, but now, of course, in a way and on a larger scale than it
was possible even for men to dream of when the city council of Nauvoo,
in 1843, authorized the construction of a dam to harness this power in
the Mississippi for the service of man. This, however, is now nearly
an accomplished fact through the enterprise of the Keokuk and Hamilton
Water Power Company, which, between Hamilton on the Illinois side,
and Keokuk on the Iowa side of the Mississippi (eight or nine miles
below Nauvoo), has in course of construction a dam which, including
abutments, will be 4,700 feet in length, will stand 32 feet above the
river bed, and be 42 feet wide at its base, built of solid concrete.
In connection with the dam, and incident to it will be wharfage and
a large drydock for the construction and repair of floating craft.
There will be developed and for sale as the result of this enterprise,
200,000 horsepower for the service of St. Louis and other towns of
Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. The dam and power house will be built at a
cost of $22,000,000.

21. Such appeared to be the very great probability in the election of
1843. As will be remembered by the readers of Vol. IV of this HISTORY,
Cyrus Walker, Esq., Whig candidate for Congress, rendered valuable
service in delivering the Prophet from the hands of those bent upon
running him into Missouri for trial on the old complaint against him
in that state. That service could only be obtained in that crisis by
Joseph Smith pledging himself to vote for Walker, which was interpreted
to mean, of course, the Mormon vote; and it was generally conceded that
the Whigs receiving the Mormon vote would be successful. Before the day
of election, however, there had arisen strong reasons for believing
that the arrest of Prophet and the effort to take him to Missouri, as
also Walker's appearance upon the scene to effect his liberation, was
itself a political trick to secure the Mormon vote for the Whig party,
which was thwarted by the Mormons voting, at the last moment, the
Democratic ticket. (See Vol. V, Chapter XXVI).

congenital love of a brawl, in the arm; Gallaghor, a Southerner from
the Mississippi bottom, in the face; Voorhees, a half-grown hobbledehoy
from Bear Creek, in the shoulder; and another gentleman, whose name I
will not mention, as he in prepared to prove an _alibi_, and besides
stands six feet two in his moccasins." In a later paragraph he refers
to "the handsome fight in the jail."

I attended with my family until five, p.m.

I copy from the_ New York Sun_ as follows:--

    "JOE SMITH, THE MORMON PROPHET." [3]

    This Joe Smith must be set down as an extraordinary character, a
    prophet-hero, as Carlyle might call him. He is one of the great men
    of this age, and in future history will rank with those who, in one
    way or another, have stamped their impress strongly on society.

    Nothing can be more plebeian, in seeming, than this Joe Smith.
    Little of dignity is there in his cognomen; but few in this age
    have done such deeds, and performed such apparent miracles. It
    is no small thing, in the blaze of this nineteenth century, to
    give to men a new revelation, found a new religion, establish new
    forms of worship, to build a city, with new laws, institutions,
    and orders of architecture,--to establish ecclesiastic, civil and
    military jurisdiction, found colleges, send out missionaries, and
    make proselytes in two hemispheres: yet all this has been done by
    Joe Smith, and that against every sort of opposition, ridicule
    and persecution. This sect has its martyrs also; and the spirit
    in which they were imprisoned and murdered in Missouri, does not
    appear to have differed much from that which has attended religious
    persecutions in all ages of the world.

    That Joe Smith, the founder of the Mormons, is a man of great
    talent, a deep thinker, and eloquent speaker, an able writer, and
    a man of great mental power, no one can doubt who has watched his
    career. That his followers are deceived, we all believe; but,
    should the inherent corruptions of Mormonism fail to develop
    themselves sufficiently to convince its followers of their error,
    where will the thing end? A great military despotism is growing
    up in the fertile West, increasing faster in proportion, than
    the surrounding population, spreading its influence around, and
    marshalling multitudes under its banners, causing serious alarm to
    every patriot.

What is the reason that men are so blind that they cannot or will not
see the hand of the Lord in His work of the last days!

_Tuesday, 5._--Went to the office at nine, a.m., with Mr. Hamilton, of
Carthage, who had obtained a deed from {4} the sheriff of the county
for lot 2, block 103, in the city of Nauvoo, for taxes, although I had
previously paid them; which is another specimen of the oppression,
injustice, and rascality of Mr. Collector Bagby, who by such foul means
robs me and other Saints, and abuses all who come unfortunately in his
power.

I requested my clerk to make out a bill of fare for the "Mansion."

The ship _Metoka_ sailed from Liverpool with a company of Saints on
board.

_Wednesday, 6.--_I went to the recorder's about half past six, a.m.,
and found him in bed.

Held mayor's court in the case, "City _versus_ Joseph Owen."

_Anti-Mormon Meeting at Carthage, Seat of Hancock, County Illinois._ [4]

Meeting convened pursuant to adjournment. The former chairman [5] not
being present.

Edson Whitney, Esq., was called to the chair, and the meeting being
organized, the following preamble and resolutions were submitted by the
committee, and unanimously adopted:--

    PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTIONS.

    This meeting having convened for the purpose of taking under
    advisement a subject of vital importance not only to this county,
    but to all the surrounding counties, regret that we are necessarily
    and irresistibly forced to the conclusion that a certain class
    of people have obtruded themselves upon us, calling themselves
    Mormons, or Latter-day Saints, and under the sacred garb of
    Christianity, assumed, as we honestly believe, that they may the
    more easily, under such a cloak, perpetrate the most lawless and
    diabolical deeds that have ever, in any age of the world, disgraced
    the human species.

    In evidence of the above charge, we find them yielding implicit
    obedience to the ostensible head and founder of this sect, who
    is a pretended prophet of the Lord, and under this Heaven-daring
    assumption {5} claiming to set aside, by his vile and blasphemous
    lies, all those moral and religious institutions which have been
    established by the Bible, and which have in all ages been cherished
    by men as the only means of maintaining those social blessings
    which are so indispensably necessary for our happiness.

    We believe that such an individual, regardless as he must be of
    his obligations to God, and at the same time entertaining the most
    absolute contempt for the laws of man, cannot fail to become a
    most dangerous character, especially when he shall have been able
    to place himself at the head of a numerous horde, either equally
    reckless and unprincipled as himself, or else made his pliant tools
    by the most absurd credulity that has astonished the world since
    its foundation.

    In the opinion of this meeting, a crisis has arrived, when many
    of the evils to be expected from a state of things so threatening
    have transpired. We feel convinced that circumstances have even now
    occurred which prove to us most conclusively that Joseph Smith, the
    false Prophet before alluded to, has evinced, in many instances,
    a most shameless disregard for all the forms and restraints of
    law, by boldly and presumptuously calling in question the acts
    of certain officers, who had fearlessly discharged the duties
    absolutely imposed upon them by the laws, particularly when they
    have come in contact with his own sordid and selfish interests.

    He has been heard to threaten--nay, he _has_ committed violence
    upon the person of an officer, because that officer dared honestly
    to do his duties according to law.

    He has caused his city council to pass laws contrary to the laws of
    the state, and subversive of the rights of citizens of this state.

    Citizens have been arrested, tried and punished for breaches of
    those mock laws, from time to time, in such manner, that they have
    been compelled to the humiliating necessity of seeking an asylum
    elsewhere, in order to escape the tyranny and oppression of this
    modern Caligula.

    He has caused the writ of _habeas corpus_ to be issued by the
    municipal court of the city of Nauvoo, in a case not provided for
    in the charter of this city, and indeed contrary to the letter of
    that instrument; and, himself a prisoner, arrested under grave
    charges made by a neighboring state, brought before said court,
    tried, and acquitted; thereby securing his own rescue from the
    custody of the law.

    Citizens from the adjoining counties have been denied the right to
    regain property stolen and taken to Nauvoo, even after they have
    discovered both the thief and the property; and themselves, under
    the most frivolous pretenses, arrested, fined, and other property
    rifled from them, to satisfy the mock judgments and costs of his
    cormorant officers.

    {6} Persons upon whom stolen property has been found in the city of
    Nauvoo, have been brought before this religio-political chief; and
    he, in the capacity of mayor of the city, has refused to convict,
    where the cases have been most clear and palpable.

    We have had men of the most vicious and abominable habits
    imposed upon us to fill our most important county offices, by
    his dictum, in order, as we verily believe, that he may the more
    certainly control our destinies, and render himself, through the
    instrumentality of these base creatures of his ill-directed power,
    as absolutely a despot over the citizens of this county as he now
    is over the serfs of his own servile clan.

    And, to crown all, he claims to merge all religion, all law, and
    both moral and political justice, in the knavish pretension that
    he receives fresh from heaven divine instructions in all matters
    pertaining to these things; thereby making his own depraved will
    the rule by which he would have all men governed.

    He has caused large bodies of his ragamuffin soldiery to arm
    themselves, and turn out in pursuit of officers legally authorized
    to arrest himself; he being charged with high crimes and
    misdemeanors committed in the state of Missouri, and these officers
    arrested by the vilest hypocrisy, and placed in duress, that he
    might enable himself to march triumphantly into Nauvoo, and bid
    defiance to the laws of the land.

    In view of the above grievances, this meeting feel that it is
    their bounden duty to resist, by every laudable means, all such
    unwarrantable attacks upon their liberties. Therefore--

    _Resolved,_ 1st. That inasmuch as we honestly believe that the
    combination of people calling themselves Mormons, or Latter-day
    Saints, have given strong indications, in their recent movements,
    that they are unwilling to submit to the ordinary restraints of
    law, we are therefore forced to the conclusion that the time is not
    far distant when the citizens of this country will be compelled to
    assert their rights in some way.

    _Resolved,_ 2nd. That while we would deprecate anything like
    lawless violence, without justifiable cause, yet we pledge
    ourselves in the most solemn manner to resist all the wrongs which
    may be hereafter attempted to be imposed on this community by the
    Mormons, to the utmost of our ability,--peaceably, if we can, but
    forcibly, if we must.

    _Resolved,_ 3rd. That in the event of our being forced into a
    collision with that people, we pledge ourselves that we will stand
    by and support each other in every emergency up to the death.

    _Resolved,_ 4th. That we believe that it is also the interest
    of our friends in the neighboring counties and also neighboring
    states to begin to take a firm and decided stand against the high
    pretension and base designs of this latter-day would-be Mahomet.

    {7} _Resolved,_ 5th. That provided we must necessarily, for the
    well-being of this community, the protection of our dearest rights,
    and the preservation of our excellent institutions, adopt measures
    to humble the pride and arrogance of that audacious despot; we
    therefore call upon all good and honest men, without distinction of
    party or place, to come to the rescue.

    _Resolved,_ 6th. That we pledge ourselves in the most determined
    manner that if the authorities of the State of Missouri shall make
    another demand for the body of Joseph Smith, and our Governor
    shall issue another warrant to stand ready at all times to serve
    the officer into whose hands such warrant may come, as a _posse_,
    in order that it may not be said of us, in future, that the most
    outrageous culprits have been suffered "to go unwhipped of justice."

    _Resolved,_ 7th. That a corresponding committee be appointed to
    communicate with the different parts of this county, and also with
    other counties; and we would also recommend to all surrounding
    counties to appoint like committees for the purpose of a mutual
    interchange of views in regard to the subjects embraced in these
    proceedings.

    _Resolved,_ 8th. That as it has been too common for several years
    past for politicians of both political parties, not only of this
    county, but likewise of the state, to go to Nauvoo and truckle
    to the heads of the Mormon clan for their influence, we pledge
    ourselves that we will not support any man of either party in
    future who shall thus debase himself.

    _Resolved,_ 9th. That if the Mormons carry out the threats they
    have made in regards to the lives of several of our citizens, we
    will, if failing to obtain speedy redress from the laws of the
    land, take summary and signal vengeance upon them as a people.

    _Resolved,_ 10th. That when the Government ceases to afford
    protection, the citizens of course fall back upon their original
    inherent right of self-defense.

    In pursuance of the 7th resolution, the following gentlemen
    were appointed to act as a central corresponding committee at
    Carthage--namely, Captain Robert F. Smith, Major T. J. Bartlet,
    Harmon T. Wilson, Frank A. Worrel, and Walter Bagby.

    On motion of Henry Stevens, it was ordered that committees,
    consisting of two persons, be appointed in each election precinct
    of this county, for the purpose of communicating with the central
    committee at Carthage; and that those two may add to their number
    at discretion.

    On motion of Daniel Beaver, it was made the duty of the person
    whose name stands first on the list of each committee to act as
    chairman; and that all communications from the other committees, or
    from any other sources shall be added.

    {8} The following gentlemen were then appointed by the chair as
    committees in the several precincts, to wit:--

    _Green Plains_--Edson Whitney and Levi Williams.

    _Bear Creek_--William White and Andrew Moore.

    _Chili_--Stephen Owen and Arthur Morgan.

    _Augusta_--William D. Abernethy and Alexander Oliver.

    _Saint Mary's_--William Darnell and Daniel Beaver.

    _Fountain Green_--Thomas Geddis and S. H. Tyler.

    _La Harpe_--Jesse Gilmer and Charles Comstock.

    _Camp Creek_--James Graham and Thomas Harris.

    _Appanooce_--John McCanley and John R. Atherton.

    _Montebello_--Samuel Steel and Benjamin B. Gates.

    _Warsaw_--Thomas C. Sharp and Mark Aldrich.

    On motion of Levi Williams, Colonel Root, of McDonough county, was
    added to the central corresponding committee of Carthage.

    On motion of Henry Newton, Esq.,

    _Resolved,_ That the central committee of correspondence act as a
    general committee of supervision; and, in case of a contingency
    occurring requiring aid, that they immediately call on the precinct
    committees and upon all others favorable to our cause to furnish
    such aid as the exigency of the case may require.

    On the motion of Charles C. Stevens, the following supplementary
    resolutions were unanimously adopted:--

    _Resolved,_ That the president of this meeting be requested to
    communicate with the Governor of Missouri, and respectfully request
    him to make another demand upon the authorities of this state for
    the body of Joseph Smith, commonly called the Mormon Prophet;
    and in the event of a requisition and an order for his arrest
    and delivery to the proper officers of the state of Missouri, we
    offer our services to enforce said order, and pledge ourselves to
    sustain the supremacy of the laws at all hazards and under all
    circumstances.

    _Resolved,_ That a copy of the proceedings of this meeting be
    forwarded to the publisher of the _Warsaw Message, Quincy Whig,_
    and _Quincy Herald,_ for publication, with a request to them to add
    a note, soliciting all editors friendly to our cause in this state,
    Missouri, and Iowa Territory, to copy.

    It was then moved and seconded, That this meeting adjourn, subject
    to the call of the central corresponding committee.

    Edson Whitney, Chairman.

    W. D. Abernethy, Secretary.

    Editors throughout Illinois, Missouri, Iowa Territory, friendly to
    the Anti-Mormon cause, are requested to publish the proceedings, in
    today's paper, of a meeting held at Carthage on the 6th instant.

{9} _Thursday, 7.--_I took home the letter written to Harrisburg
[6] for the Church History, a small fragment of which only has been
preserved, and is as follows:--

    _Historical Sketch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints._

    Messrs. Editors,--The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
    was founded upon direct revelation, as the true Church of God
    has ever been, according to the Scriptures (Amos 3:7, and Acts
    1:2); and through the will and blessings of God, I have been an
    instrument in his hands, thus far, to move forward the cause of
    Zion: therefore, in order to fulfill the solicitations of your
    letter of July last, I shall commence with my life.

    [Then follows a brief historical sketch of the Church from the
    birth of the Prophet to the settlement of the Saints at Nauvoo,
    much in the strain of the _"Wentworth Letter"_ already published in
    this HISTORY, (Vol. IV, Ch. XXXI); and for the reason that all the
    historical data in this I. Daniel Rupp sketch is contained in the
    _Wentworth Letter,_ it is thought unnecessary to reproduce it here,
    excepting the closing paragraphs which deal with conditions and
    prospects at Nauvoo, on the date at which we have arrived in our
    HISTORY, viz. September, 1843.--Editor.]

    Nauvoo, upon every point connected with increase and prosperity
    has exceeded the most sanguine expectations of thousands. It now
    contains near 3,500 houses, and more than 15,000 inhabitants.
    The charter contains, among its important powers, privileges or
    immunities, a grant for "The University of Nauvoo," with the same
    liberal powers of the city, where all the arts and sciences will
    grow with the growth and strengthen the strength of this beloved
    city of the Saints of the last days.

    Another very commendatory provision of the charter is that that
    portion of the citizens subject to military duty are organized
    into a body of independent military men, styled the "Nauvoo
    Legion," whose highest officer holds the rank and is commissioned
    lieutenant-general. This Legion, like other independent bodies of
    troops in this Republican Government, is at the disposal of the
    Governor of the state, and President of the United States. There is
    also an act of incorporation for an Agricultural and Manufacturing
    Association, as well as the Nauvoo House Association.

    Since the organization of this Church, its progress has been rapid,
    and its gain in numbers regular. Besides these United States, where
    {10} nearly every place of notoriety has heard the glad tidings
    of the Gospel of the Son of God, England, Ireland and Scotland
    have shared largely in the fullness of the everlasting Gospel, and
    thousands have already gathered with their kindred Saints to this
    the corner stone of Zion. Missionaries of this Church have gone
    to the East Indies, to Australia, Germany, Constantinople, Egypt,
    Palestine, the islands of the Pacific, and are now preparing to
    open the door in the extensive dominions of Russia.

    There is no correct data by which the exact number of members
    composing this now extensive and still extending Church of Jesus
    Christ of Latter-day Saints can be known. Should it be supposed at
    150,000, it might still be short of the truth.

    Believing the Bible to say what it means and mean what it says,
    and guided by revelation, according to the ancient order of the
    fathers, to whom came what little light we enjoy, and circumscribed
    only by the eternal limits of truth, this Church must continue the
    even tenor of its way.

    Conference opened with prayer by Elder George A. Smith.

    After the various branches in the New England States were
    represented, Elder P. P. Pratt made a few remarks, of which the
    following is a synopsis:

    Some Elders tell us that they have taught the gathering according
    to the Scriptures. But it is not sufficient to teach the principle
    from the Scriptures alone; for if there was no other guide, the
    people would be left in doubt as to whether they should gather to
    Jerusalem, Africa, America, or elsewhere. It is right to teach the
    gathering according to the Scriptures, although some predictions
    of the Prophets are obscure; but we are not left to them alone.
    We know and all the Saints ought to know that God has appointed a
    place and time of gathering and has raised up a Prophet to bring
    it about, of which we are witnesses. Our message is that we are
    witnesses of the fulfillment of the predictions of the Prophets.

    We have not to lay down a long, round-about [system] of arguments
    and calculations. The specific time and place are pointed out, the
    stakes are driven, the foundations of the city and temple are laid,
    and a people already gathered. We therefore know where to go; and
    to reject the revelations of God, which have pointed out these
    things to us, only brings condemnation. If this is not the case,
    then our faith is vain, and our works and hopes are vain also.

    We worship a God who can inspire His servants to tell the people
    what to do. We have already got the opinions of men enough
    concerning the coming of Jesus Christ; but we need the voice of a
    Prophet in such a case and we have it. I am willing to risk my all
    upon it: and if the Elders understand the principle of gathering,
    and teach it correctly, the people will have the correct spirit of
    the gathering.

    It is time we come out and declared boldly and definitely what God
    had for the people. We want more than opinions--we want your works.
    He has said he would send a Prophet to prepare the way. And {12}
    let me ask these profound sectarians, why He has not done it? If
    the angels found a God in heaven able to give instructions, shield
    them from sword and famine, &c., why have we not found Him? Let
    the teachers bear the message they are entrusted with; and if the
    people wish then for Scripture, tell them that their message is in
    fulfillment of prophecy; but let them have the whole message.

    Elder E. P. Maginn said he for one had taught the gathering
    according to the Scriptures; but he considered all modern
    revelations Scripture as well as those given anciently.

    Elder Brigham Young addressed the meeting on the subject of our
    faith. We hear the Elders represent the feeling of the brethren
    concerning the gathering. This is right. The Spirit of the Lord
    Jesus Christ is a gathering spirit. Its tendency is to gather the
    virtuous and good, the honest and meek of the earth, and, in fine,
    the Saints of God. The time has come when the Lord is determined
    to fulfill his purposes. The people are apt to say that if they
    had lived in the days of Jesus Christ they would have received His
    work. But judge ye if the people are better now than then. They are
    not. When the full, set time was come, the Lord came in the flesh
    to do His work, whether the people were prepared or not; and He
    would not have come at all, if He had waited till the people were
    prepared to receive Him. It was decreed from all eternity that He
    should come, and He came. The people were not prepared then, nor
    are they any more prepared now. And now the full set time has come
    for the Lord God Almighty to set His hand to redeem Israel. We are
    not bound to make the people believe, but we are bound to preach
    the Gospel; and having done this, our garments are clear.

    The Lord does not require every soul to leave his home as soon as
    He believes. Some may be wanted to go to the isles of the sea, and
    some to go north, and some south. But He _does_ require them to
    hearken to counsel, and follow that course which He points out,
    whether to gather or stay to do some other work.

    The Spirit of the Lord and His work are on the alert, and those who
    keep up with the work must be on the alert also. The Spirit of the
    Lord will leave them who sit down and refuse to obey. When the Lord
    says, "Gather yourselves together," why do you ask Him what for?
    Had you not rather enjoy the society of Saints than sinners whom
    you cannot love? Is it not the principle of the Saints to mingle
    together and promote the great cause in which they are engaged?

    Perhaps some of you are ready to ask, "Cannot the Lord save us as
    well where we are as to gather together?" Yes, if the Lord says
    so. But if He commands us to come out and gather together, He will
    not save us by staying at home. Have you not received the Gospel?
    Yes. {13} Then do you believe what we say? Have you not received
    the Holy Ghost, by receiving the Gospel which we have brought unto
    you? Yes, thousands have; and it stands as a testimony that God has
    got a Prophet on the earth. You might have been baptized seventy
    times seven in any way except the way God had ordained and pointed
    out, and you would not have received the Holy Ghost. This also is a
    testimony to you.

    Are you engaged with us in this great work? "Yes, certainly," you
    answer, "heart and hand." "Can we do any good?" Yes, you can. The
    sectarian world send the Bible to the nations of the earth. The
    poor among them put sixpence, fifty cents or a dollar into the box
    to carry out that object; and can the Latter-day Saints do nothing?
    Let them do what God requires. He has required that we should build
    a house unto His name, that the ordinances and blessings of His
    kingdom may be revealed, and that the Elders may be endowed, go
    forth and gather together the blood of Ephraim--the people of God,
    from the ends of the earth.

    Can you get an endowment in Boston or anywhere, except where God
    appoints? No, only in that place which God has pointed out. Now,
    query--Could Moses have obtained the law if he had stayed in
    the midst of the children of Israel, instead of going up on to
    the mountain? The Lord said, "Go and do so and so; stand before
    Pharaoh; pull off thy shoes, for the place is holy." Moses obeyed,
    and obtained blessings which he would not have received if he had
    been disobedient.

    Has the Lord spoken in these last days, and required us to build
    Him a house? Then why query about it? If He has spoken, it is
    enough. I do not care whether the people gather or not, if they
    don't want to do so. I do not wish to save the people against their
    will. I want them to choose whether they will gather and be saved
    with the righteous, or remain with the wicked and be damned. I
    would like to have all people bow down to the Lord Jesus Christ;
    but it is one of the decrees of the Lord that all persons shall act
    upon their agency, which was the case even with the angels who fell
    from heaven.

    Now, will you help us to build the Nauvoo House and Temple? If so,
    you will be blessed: if not, we will build it without you. And if
    you don't hearken, you will not have the Spirit of the Lord; for
    the Spirit of the Lord is on the move.

    The Apostles tried to gather the people together in their day.
    Christ said He would gather the Jews oft as a hen gathereth her
    chickens under her wings, but they would not. Neither God nor
    angels care whether men hear or forbear: they will carry on their
    work; for the full, set time is come for God to set up His kingdom,
    and we go about it. We must build a house, and get an endowment,
    preach the gospel, {14} warn the people, gather the Saints, build
    up Zion, finish our work, and be prepared for the coming of Christ.

    Now, we want to send four missionaries to the Pacific Islands,
    and we want a little clothing, and beds, and money to pay their
    passage. Can you do something for them? This is not all. We want
    you to give all you have to spare towards building the Temple.
    We shall be able to build it, if we have to work with a sword in
    one hand. But perhaps you are afraid you will not have enough for
    yourself, when you get there; yet how easy it is for the Lord to
    take it away from you by fire or otherwise!

    Elder Maginn had an ivory cane. I asked him for it, but he declined
    making me a present of it. Not long after, he had it stolen from
    him in a crowd, and it now does neither of us any good. Perhaps
    your purse may slip through your pocket, or you may lose your
    property; for the Lord can give and take away. Jacob, with his
    faith, obtained all the best cattle his father-in-law had.

    If I had a wife and ten children, I would give all my money to
    build the Temple and Nauvoo House, and I would trust in God for
    their support. Yet I will be richer for it; for God would prosper
    me in business. Men are apt to serve God on Sunday, and neglect Him
    all the week. Who blesses you and all the people? God. But do the
    people acknowledge the hand of God in all these things? No; they
    turn away from Him, and do not acknowledge Him, or realize from
    whom their blessings flow. They know not who blesses them. It never
    comes into their hearts. So with the farmer. The blessings are
    constantly flowing to him, and he considers not whence they come.

    Let me tell you a secret. When the Lord shakes the earth, and every
    valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made
    low, He will bring gold for brass, silver for iron, brass for wood,
    and iron for stones. Then you will have no use for gold, for money
    and gods as you now have. You will not care so much about it; but
    the Lord will think as much of it then as now.

    But now we want some of the gods of the Gentiles--some of the
    gold and silver to build the Temple and Nauvoo House for the
    accommodation of the kings, princes and nobles of the earth, when
    they come to inquire after the wisdom of Zion, that they may have
    a place for their entertainment, and for the weary traveler to be
    refreshed. Let us have your gold to take to Nauvoo for this purpose.

    Is there wisdom in Zion? We think so, and the world begins to think
    so. Let the world come forward and translate the plates that have
    of late come forth, [7] if they have wisdom to do it. The Lord {15}
    intends to take away the gods of the Gentiles: He pulleth down and
    He buildeth up at His own pleasure.

    Sacrifice your gods for the building up of Zion. Administer of your
    substance. Send our missionaries to the islands of the seas. Don't
    be afraid of a dollar, or a hundred dollars, or even a thousand
    dollars. I would not. I have made a sacrifice of all I possessed
    a good many times. I am richer the more I give; for the Lord has
    promised and does reward me a hundredfold; and if I sacrifice all
    for the cause of God, no good thing will be withheld from me. I
    have taken this course to get rich. I have given all I had, and
    God has given many blessings in consequence. If I am too bold in
    asking, be too bold in giving. I ask, expecting to receive. Put
    your shoulders to the wheel with all your might. Give your all, and
    become rich by receiving a hundredfold.

    Adjourned until half-past two o'clock, when the meeting was opened
    by singing.

    Prayer by Elder Parley P. Pratt. Singing.

    Elder Parley P. Pratt said: I have a few remarks to make concerning
    the subject spoken of in the forenoon by Elder Brigham Young, who
    said we wanted all your gold, silver, and precious things. We not
    only want your all as pertaining to gold, silver, &c., but we want
    you, your wives and children, and all you have to be engaged in the
    work of the Lord.

    I don't know that I can give you a better pattern of what we want
    than the case of Joseph in Egypt. Israelites will get all they
    can. They are very great to go ahead. The Egyptians believed in
    dreams; and by the peculiar gift of interpretation of dreams,
    Joseph entered into a great scheme of speculation. He used the gift
    of interpretation to become great in the eyes of the Egyptians. He
    obtained great political influence, came out with gold ornaments,
    and rode in the king's chariot in great splendor. He laid up corn
    in great abundance during the seven years of plenty; and when the
    famine came, he got all their gold, silver, cattle, land, property,
    and, finally their persons. * * *

    God is the origin of power--the Sovereign. He made the people and
    the earth, and He has the right to reign. There will be good times
    and good government, when the world will acknowledge the God of
    heaven as the Lawgiver, and not till then; and if I could live
    under His government, I should be thankful, although I am a real
    Republican in principle, and would rather live under the voice of
    the people than the voice of one man. But it will be for the good
    and happiness of man when that government is established, which we
    pray for when we say, "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth
    as it is in heaven;" and until that time arrives we must pray for
    it.

    {16} This Joseph in Egypt--the speculator--what a great and good
    man he was! I love him, I admire his course, and I believe a little
    of his blood is in my veins. But had Joseph been like the religious
    world at the present day--had he said he had got religion and done
    with the world, he would not have rode the king's horse, worn his
    robe, or had to do with gold and silver; and he would have done
    no good, built no storehouses, and saved no corn, for fear of
    speculation.

    But he acted differently. And there is an ancient prediction
    respecting our modern prophet, Joseph--namely, that a prophet and
    seer should be raised up, and those who seek to destroy him shall
    be confounded. This has proved true. Upwards of thirty law suits
    have been brought against the Lord's anointed, and his persecutors
    have as often been confounded. He has been raised and supported
    according to the prophecy, to do a work on the earth, and the Lord
    has been with him. Every weapon formed against him has been broken.
    He has overcome all the lawsuits which have been brought against
    him, and no accusation has been sustained against him; yet he will
    lay a plan to speculate as large as ancient Joseph did; he will
    have power to buy up all the rest of the world.

    What Elder Young said is good. We want all he spoke of, and a great
    deal more, We do not want it for ourselves, but for you. We want
    you to use it; and we have a Prophet who tells how, when and where
    to use it. Take your means and unite your exertions in this work.
    We want you to take that course which will save you. Build up a
    city and temples, and enjoy them, and do as the Lord tells you, and
    hearken to counsel.

    We have prophets to tell us what to do, and we should get as much
    wisdom as the world. If they want a railroad built, all they have
    to do is to open books. The people subscribe stock, a railroad is
    soon built, and an income is realized. The Saints ought to be as
    well united as the world, and do the things that God has required,
    that a great nation may be saved from all nations.

    The old gentleman [Satan] that rules the nations has ruled long
    enough; and if I were an infidel, I would like to have the Lord
    raise up a Joseph, or a Daniel, or a Mordecai, or an Esther, to
    obtain political, temporal, and spiritual power, and cause a change
    for the good of the world. Thank heaven, he has begun to raise them
    up. He has raised up another Joseph to do the great work of God,
    and it will continue on until the saying goes forth that the Lord
    has built up Zion.

    The kingdom of God must be established, and it will be. I read that
    gold, silver, power, thrones, and dominions will be connected with
    the great work of God in the last days. Then let us wake up {17} to
    see what God says shall come to pass, and let us enlarge our hearts
    and prepare for the great and glorious work.

    Do the Saints here in Boston know that they are identified with
    the laying of the foundation, and establishing of a great and
    mighty kingdom, which is to include all the great and glorious work
    to be fulfilled in the last dispensation and fullness of times?
    And I prophesy, in the name of the Lord, that whether the Saints
    of Boston or any other place, stand for it or rise against it,
    numberless millions will celebrate that day when the foundation of
    this work was laid.

    Elder George A. Smith said: I am pleased with the many remarks
    which have been made this day. You can easily see a similarity
    between the two Josephs, and the revelations that are given for the
    salvation of the present generation. Joseph in Egypt, a savior of
    his father's house and the Egyptians: Joseph [Smith] at this day
    holds the keys of salvation not only to the Gentiles, but also to
    the house of Israel.

    I do not know but some may have reflections different from my own.
    I will, however, show how the Lord deals with mankind. Some may
    say, "Who can believe that God who dwells in heaven will condescend
    to speak to the people about building Him a house in this day of
    religion and science?"

    This may be considered simple in the eyes of many; but the day
    was when the salvation or damnation of the whole world hung upon
    as small a circumstance. "Noah, by faith, being warned of God of
    things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the
    saving of his house, by which he condemned the world, and became
    heir of the righteous which is by faith."

    Had the editors of this day lived then, I think they would have
    said and written more against it than they have against Joseph
    Smith and the revelations he has received and published.

    We find God was in the habit of telling men to do many simple
    things, even to the giving of a law concerning the protection of
    birds' nests. You talk about God condescending to speak of small
    things in the last days, but it is only as it was in the days of
    Moses; for we read in the Bible how God commanded the children of
    Israel, when they found a bird's nest, (Deut. XXII:7) not to take
    the dam with the young: "But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go,
    and take the young to thee." Why? "That it may be well with thee,
    and that thou mayst prolong thy days."

    We see from this, that however small and simple the commandments of
    God appear to be, they are great in their results. Connecting this
    with the law of God to Israel concerning the eating of locusts,
    beetles and grasshoppers (Leviticus XI:22). "Even these of them ye
    may {18} eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after
    his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after
    his kind."

    Is this as small business for the Lord to talk about as it is for
    Him to command the Saints to build a tavern or boarding house for
    visitors who constantly go to Nauvoo, which, when done, will do
    much good for the spreading of the work to all nations. What good
    could arise from a law of God permitting the eating of beetles and
    grasshoppers, I cannot say.

    All the prophecies have aimed at the gathering of the people, and
    saving them in the last days. But it is better never to have known
    the Master's will than to know it and not perform it; and my advice
    is, If you cannot take hold of the work and go through the whole
    course, stop and go no further. If you have not courage to go on at
    the expense of all things, it is better to turn back.

    We do not want to deceive you. Our traditions have taught us to be
    very religious, to wear long faces, never to tell an amusing story,
    nor to laugh, &c. This was the case with the long-faced Christians
    in Missouri, and they were the first to strike a dagger to our
    hearts. It is better for a man to act out what he is than to be a
    hypocrite. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father,
    is this," says James, "to visit the fatherless and widows in their
    affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."

    I do not like that religion which lies in a man's long face, or his
    coat or his hat. If I wear a strange hat, it is not because of my
    religion: for where the religion of a man is in the shape of a hat
    or coat, it is not very extensive anywhere else.

    Some of the Elders want to appear very big, and to be called great
    preachers; but whenever I have seen them trying to preach something
    large and mysterious, to get a name, I have concluded they have yet
    much to learn. I have been eleven years a member of this Church,
    and was a believer two years before I entered it; and during
    that time I have seen many Elders who like to preach large and
    mysterious sermons.

    As many are desirous of hearing mysteries, I will rehearse a short
    sermon of mysteries for their edification. Elder Kimball has had a
    long standing in the Church. He has preached much, done much good,
    brought many souls into the kingdom, had great influence, and is
    considered the most successful minister among us.

    Elder Amasa Lyman and myself went into Pike county, Illinois,
    to preach where the Elders had preached all the mysteries about
    beasts, heads and horns. They wanted us to preach mysteries. We
    told them we were not qualified to preach mysteries; but if they
    would send for Elder Kimball he would preach them. So they sent
    about forty miles {19} for Elder Kimball, and brought him down, they
    were so anxious to hear mysteries.

    When he came, he had a large congregation assembled. He arose and
    remarked that he understood they had sent for him to come and
    preach the mysteries to them. "I am well qualified, and fully
    competent to do it, and am happy to have the privilege. I want
    the attention of all." When every mind was stretched and eager to
    learn these great mysteries he said, "The first mystery I shall
    present before you is this, 'Look at Elder Amasa Lyman; he needs
    a pair of pantaloons and a new hat. But it appears you do not see
    it; consequently I want to open your eyes and reveal to you a
    great mystery; for an Elder in the Church has need of a hat and a
    pair of breeches as well as yourselves, and _especially_ when the
    Saints _know_ he is so much in need of them!'" He preached a few
    more mysteries of the same nature, and the result of this sermon
    was that Elder Lyman got a pair of pants and a new hat, and Elder
    Kimball and myself each a barrel of flour for our families.

    Elder Brigham Young arose and said: I will make an apology for my
    remarks in the former part of the day. Some may think I spoke very
    plainly; but the object I had in view was to teach you your duty,
    as I am aware the people are not made to feel it; and the apology I
    have to make is this: I will turn Thomsonian doctor, and give the
    composition without cream and sugar,--it matters not whether I get
    friends or foes. If this work does not live, I do not want to live;
    for it is my life, my joy, my all; and if it sinks, God knows I do
    not want to swim.

    I wish you to understand this--that he that gathereth not with
    us scattereth, and they have not the Spirit of God. We live in
    anticipation of the day when mobs cannot harm us, and they who have
    tasted the bitter cup feel to realize this hope. Wake up, ye Elders
    of Israel who have sought to build yourselves up, and not the
    kingdom of God, and put on your sword. Wake up, ye that have daubed
    with untempered mortar! Hearken and hear me; for I say unto you, in
    the name of Jesus Christ, that if you do not help us to build the
    Temple and the Nauvoo House, you shall not inherit the land of Zion.

    If you do not help to build up Zion and the cause of God, and help
    me and my brethren on our way when we want to go on the Lord's
    business, you shall not partake of the blessings which are laid
    up in store for the Saints. Many Elders seek to build themselves
    up, and not the work of the Lord. They will say "Put gold rings on
    my fingers; give me what I want;" and they care nothing about the
    Temple. This they should not do. I will not allow myself to do so;
    and when any one does this, no matter who he may be, even though
    he was one {20} of the Twelve, he will not prosper. Those of the
    Twelve and others of the Elders who have apostatized, I have known
    their hearts and their breathings. I have known their movements
    although they thought I did not know much. But I knew all about
    them; and when I see men preaching to build themselves up, and not
    Zion, I know what it will end in. But you may say you are young.
    I don't care if you are. Are you old enough to know what you are
    about? If so, preach and labor for the building up of the city of
    Zion; concentrate your means and influence there, and not scatter
    abroad. Instead of which, some of the Elders appear to be dumb and
    lazy, and care for nothing but themselves.

    Now, ye Elders, will you be faithful? If not, you will not be
    chosen, for the day of choosing is at the door. Why be afraid of
    a sacrifice? I have given my all many times, and am willing to do
    it again. I would be glad to hear the Lord say through His servant
    Joseph, "Let my servant Brigham give again all that he has," I
    would obey it in a moment, if it took the last coat off my back.

    A hymn was sung.

    Elder Kimball arose and said: I get up of necessity to say a few
    words. I am unwell, but I feel the importance of this work. I
    have been a member of this Church twelve years. I came out of the
    Baptist church and joined this with all my heart, as I was seeking
    after truth. I have passed through everything but death; in fact
    I have been brought into situations even worse than death. It has
    been my lot and privilege to sacrifice all I possessed from time to
    time; and we have come here to call for help to build the Temple
    and Nauvoo House. I have spent thirty dollars to get here, and have
    collected fifteen and that with much difficulty.

    We were commanded of the Lord to come: but it seems as though
    but few felt interested in it. Here I see four brethren going as
    missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, and destitute of means to
    help themselves. I could weep for them. I feel interested in this
    great work. We are seeking to bring about a work that could never
    before be performed.

    When the time is brought about that we are to receive our
    inheritances, the more faithful we are, the larger will be our
    reward. We have come out to reap, but do we have time to reap new
    grain? No; for it takes all our time to try to save that which is
    already reaped.

    We have reapers in the field, and we are trying to save the wheat.
    We want to get it on the barn floor, so that we may thrash it.
    We have come after it to warn you. You think Elder Young put the
    flail on rather heavy; but it is nothing to be compared with the
    thrashing you will get in Zion, and those who have the hardest
    heads will, of {21} course, have to be thrashed the hardest. But
    don't be troubled about the chaff when it comes to the barn, for
    God will prepare a great winnowing mill which will blow all the
    chaff away, and the wheat will be found before the mill: then it
    has to go through the smut machine, then ground, then put through
    the bolting machine, and many will bolt in going through. I speak
    in parables. I compare the Saints to a good cow. When you milk
    her clean, she will always have an abundance of milk to give; but
    if you only milk her a little, and don't strip her, she will soon
    dry up. So with the Saints: if they do but little in building up
    Zion, they soon have but little to do with. This was the case in
    Cincinnati.

    The night before arriving at Cincinnati, I had a dream while on the
    steamboat. I dreamt that I had a wagon with a rack on it, and an
    individual with me. We were going to a field of wheat of mine that
    had been cut, bound and shocked up, in order to haul into the barn.
    When we came to the field, I jumped off the wagon, and got over the
    fence to examine it, pulled off the cap sheaf, and behold it was
    oats. Pulling the bundles apart, I found there were clusters of
    rats. On further examination I found clusters of mice, and the oats
    were all eaten up.

    In my dream I was going to haul in wheat, but to my astonishment it
    was oats, and they were all eaten up by the rats and mice.

    I thought these rats and mice were the Elders and official members
    who had been in and lain on the Church at Cincinnati--lived on the
    wheat--eaten it up instead of building up new branches; so that
    when the Twelve came along, they could not get anything for the
    Temple or Nauvoo House, or hardly a place to stay. The rats had
    eaten up the wheat, so we had to go to the world for a home to stay
    while we were there.

    We do not profess to be polished stones like Elders Almon W.
    Babbitt, George J. Adams, James Blakeslee, and Eli P. Maginn, &c.,
    &c.; but we are rough stones out of the mountain; and when we roll
    through the forest, and knock the bark from the trees, it does not
    hurt us, even if we should get a corner knocked off occasionally;
    for the more we roll about, and knock the corners off, the better
    we are; but if we were polished and smooth when we get the corners
    knocked off, it would deface us.

    Joseph Smith never professed to be a dressed, smooth, polished
    stone, but to have come rough out of the mountain; and he has
    been rolling among the rocks and trees, yet it has not hurt him
    at all: but he will be as smooth and polished in the end as any
    other stone, while many who were so very polished and smooth in
    the beginning get badly defaced and spoiled while they are rolling
    about.

    Elder Parley P. Pratt said--Some are going to Zion, and the rest
    {22} want to know what they shall do. The Lord, through Jeremiah
    (III, 14,15) says, "I will take you one of a city, and two of a
    family, and I will bring you to Zion; and I will give you pastors
    according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and
    understanding." Inasmuch as you hearken to counsel, you will know
    what the will of the Lord is concerning you in all things. Meet
    often together to worship God and to speak to each other of the
    things of God. Gather as soon as you can. Come up to the mountain
    of the Lord's house, and there learn of these things, that the
    Scriptures may be fulfilled.

    Elder Orson Pratt said--I do not know that I can say anything to
    impress the subjects which have been spoken upon more fully upon
    your minds than has been done. There are some things, however, I
    wish to mention. We have learned from what we have heard this day
    that great blessings will be given to the faithful when the Temple
    is finished. I will speak of some of the consequences that will
    follow, if we do not obey.

    When the Temple is reared, God will manifest Himself in a peculiar
    manner. If we are obedient, He has told us He will make manifest
    to us things we are ignorant of. He has said He will reveal things
    which pertain to this dispensation that have been hidden and kept
    secret from the foundation of the world.

    No former age or generation of the world have had the same things
    revealed: all other dispensations will be swallowed up in this. He
    declares, in His revelations, the consequences of not building the
    house unto His name within such a time. The Lord says, If you build
    the house in that time, you shall be blessed; but if not, you shall
    be rejected as a church with your dead, saith the Lord. So, if that
    house is not built, then in vain are all our cares; our faith and
    works, our meetings and hopes are vain also; our performances and
    acts will be void.

    The servants of God who are faithful and do their duty will get
    the blessing; and we are determined to do our duty, and lay these
    principles before the Saints, so that they may have the privilege
    of contributing. We will turn this responsibility upon the heads of
    the Saints; then our garments will be clear, and the Lord is able
    and will be willing to endow all the faithful in some other place.

    This Church, in its infancy, was directed to do a certain work, and
    the consequences pointed out. The Lord gave a revelation several
    years since to the Church to appoint our wise men, and send up
    our moneys by them to buy land; if not, we should not have an
    inheritance, but our enemies should be upon us. We went through
    and told the Saints these things; but did the churches do as God
    commanded? No, they did not. But the revelation was fulfilled, and
    the enemies of the Saints came upon them, and drove them from their
    houses and homes, {23} and finally from the State of Missouri. This was
    in consequence of their disobeying the commandments of God through
    His servant Joseph.

    Many suppose they must get direct revelation from God for
    themselves. Not so. He has a prophet, and he says the Church shall
    give heed to the words of the Prophet, as he is to hold the keys of
    the kingdom of God in this life and in the world to come. Then it
    is of much consequence that you give heed to his word.

    Says one, Suppose we are not satisfied that this is the work of
    God? You can ask God if the work is true, and He will give you a
    testimony. You can put every confidence in the Book of Mormon and
    in Joseph, the Prophet; and if you are not satisfied, go to God. I
    doubt in my own mind if men can stand what they will have to pass
    through, unless they do get a witness for themselves; and I pray
    you to give heed to the words which the Twelve have taught you, and
    ask God to help you.

    The conference was adjourned until ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

    _Sunday,_ 10th. Conference met according to adjournment.

    Meeting was opened by singing, and prayer by Elder Maginn; after
    which Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed the assembly from Amos
    III:7--"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his
    secret unto his servants the prophets?" According to the testimony
    of the Scriptures in all ages of the world, whenever God was about
    to bring a judgment upon the world or accomplish any great work,
    the first thing he did was to raise up a Prophet, and reveal unto
    him the secret, and send him to warn the people, so that they may
    be left without excuse. This was the case in the days of Noah and
    Lot. God was about to bring judgments upon the people, and he
    raised up those Prophets who warned the people of it; yet they gave
    no heed to them, but rejected their testimony; and the judgments
    came upon the people, so that they were destroyed, while the
    Prophets were saved by pursuing the course marked out by the Lord.

    Jesus Christ testified to the Jews of the things that awaited them
    as a nation, the fall of Jerusalem, and their dispersion among
    the Gentile world; but they did not believe it. Yet the secret of
    all these things was revealed to the Prophets and Apostles. They
    believed it, and looked for its fulfillment; and it came to pass as
    it was predicted, though contrary to the expectation of the Jewish
    nation.

    In like manner do we look for the certain fulfillment of those
    tremendous events upon the heads of the Gentile world which have
    been spoken of and pointed out by all the holy Prophets and
    Apostles since the world began, they having spoken as they were
    moved upon by the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost,
    events which more deeply {24} concern the Gentile world than the
    overthrow of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jews did the
    Jewish nation; for while they stumbled at the stone they were
    broken; but when it falls upon the heads of the Gentile world, it
    will grind them to powder.

    The full set time is come for the Lord to set His hand to
    accomplish these mighty events; and as He has done in other ages,
    so has He done now--He has raised up a Prophet, and is revealing
    unto him His secrets. Through that Prophet He has brought to light
    the fullness of the everlasting Gospel to the present generation,
    and is again once more for the last time establishing His Church
    upon the foundation of the ancient Apostles and Prophets, which is
    revelation, Jesus Christ being the chief corner stone.

    In the Church is now found judges as at the first, and counselors
    as at the beginning; also Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors,
    and Teachers, with gifts and graces, for the perfecting of the
    Saints, the work of the ministry, and the edifying of the body of
    Christ.

    The Lord has raised up His servants, and sent them into the
    vineyard to prune it once more for the last time, to preach the
    Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to warn the nations, that they may be
    left without excuse in the day of their visitation; also to gather
    the honest in heart and the meek of the earth, that Zion may be
    built up, and the sayings of the Prophets fulfilled.

    One of the secrets that God has revealed unto his Prophet in these
    days is the Book of Mormon; and it was a secret to the whole world
    until it was revealed unto Joseph Smith, whom God has raised up
    as a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator unto His people. This record
    contains an account of the ancient inhabitants of this continent
    and of the cities with which they overspread this land from sea
    to sea, the ruins of which still remain as standing monuments of
    the arts, science, power, and greatness of their founders. It
    also points out the establishing of this our own nation, with the
    conditions for its progress, and those predictions contained in
    the Book of Mormon--the stick of Joseph in the hand of Ephraim,
    will as truly be fulfilled as those contained in the Bible--the
    stick and record of Judah; and both these sticks or records contain
    prophecies of great import concerning the Gentile nations, and
    especially this land and nation, which are not yet fulfilled, but
    must shortly come to pass: yea, their fulfillment is nigh, even at
    the doors.

    Though the secrets which God is revealing through His servant the
    Prophet in these last days may be unpopular and unbelieved in by
    the world, yet their unbelief will not make the truth of God of
    none effect, any more than it did in the days of Lot and Noah, or
    at the fall of Jerusalem.

    When Jesus Christ said there should not be left one stone upon
    {25} another in the temple that should not be thrown down, the
    Jewish nation did not believe it, neither would they receive such
    testimony; but they looked at outward circumstances, and were
    ready to say, "Who can prevail against us? What nation like unto
    our nation? We have held the giving of the law, the oracles, and
    the Urim and Thummim; the lawgiver has never departed from between
    our feet; we have held the power of government from generation to
    generation; and what nation hath power now to prevail against us?"

    Through this order of reasoning they were blinded, and knew not
    the day of their visitation: they understood not the things that
    belonged to their peace; they rejected their Lord and King,
    contended against the word and testimony, and finally put Him to
    death on the cross, with many who followed Him. But this did not
    hinder the fulfillment of His predictions concerning that nation.
    The words of the Lord had gone forth out of His mouth, and could
    not return unto Him void. The things that belonged to their peace
    were hid from their eyes, and they were counted unworthy as a
    nation. The kingdom was to be rent out of their hands and given to
    another; the die was cast, and judgment must come.

    Jerusalem was soon surrounded by the Roman army, led on by the
    inspired Titus; and a scene of calamity, judgment, and woe
    immediately overspread the inhabitants of that city, which was
    devoted to destruction,--such a calamity as never before rested
    upon the nation of Israel. Blood flowed through their streets;
    tens of thousands fell by the edge of the sword, and thousands by
    famine. Women were evil towards the children of their own bosoms
    in the straitness of the siege, the spectacle of which shocked the
    Roman soldiers as they entered the city. The Jews were crucified in
    such numbers by their enemies that they could find no more wood for
    crosses, or room for their bodies; and while despair was in every
    face, and every heart sinking while suffering under the chastening
    hand of God, their enemies rushed upon them in the city to strike
    the last fatal blow; and, as their last resort, they rushed for
    safety into the temple, which was soon on fire, and they sank in
    the midst of the flames with the cry of their sufferings ascending
    up on high, accompanied by the smoke of the crackling spires and
    towers.

    The remaining population were sold as slaves, and driven like the
    dumb ass under his burthen, and scattered, as corn is sifted in
    a sieve, throughout the Gentile world. Jerusalem was razed from
    its foundations, the ruins of the temple thrown down, and the
    foundation thereof ploughed up, that not one stone was left upon
    another. Christ said that Jerusalem should be trodden down of the
    Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled, which has
    been the case to the very letter until the present generation.

    {26} Will not God in like manner as truly and faithfully bring to
    pass those great, important and tremendous events upon the heads
    of the Gentile world which have been proclaimed by the Prophets
    Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and many other holy Prophets;
    also by Christ and the Apostles on the continent of Asia, as well
    as by Lehi, Nephi, Alma, Moroni, and others on this continent--all
    of whom have proclaimed these things as they were moved upon by the
    Spirit of inspiration, the power of God, and the gift of the Holy
    Ghost?

    The Apostle says that "No prophecy of the Scripture is of any
    private interpretation, for the prophecy came not of old time by
    the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by
    the Holy Ghost."

    Isaiah's soul seemed to be on fire, and his mind wrapt in the
    visions of the Almighty, while he declared, in the name of the
    Lord, that it should come to pass in the last days that God should
    set His hand again the second time to recover the remnant of His
    people, assemble the outcasts of Israel, gather together the
    dispersed of Judah, destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea and make
    men go over dry-shod, gather them to Jerusalem on horses, mules,
    swift beasts, and in chariots, and rebuild Jerusalem upon her own
    heaps; while, at the same time, the destroyer of the Gentiles will
    be on his way; and while God was turning the captivity of Israel,
    he would put all their curses and afflictions upon the heads of
    the Gentiles, their enemies, who had not sought to recover, but to
    destroy them, and had trodden them under foot from generation to
    generation.

    At the same time the standard should be lifted up, that the honest
    in heart, the meek of the earth among the Gentiles, should seek
    unto it; and that Zion should be redeemed and be built up a holy
    city, that the glory and power of God should rest upon her, and
    be seen upon her; that the watchman upon Mount Ephraim might
    cry--"Arise ye, and let us go up unto Zion, the city of the Lord
    our God;" that the Gentiles might come to her light, and kings
    to the brightness of her rising; that the Saints of God may have
    a place to flee to and stand in holy places while judgment works
    in the earth; that when the sword of God that is bathed in heaven
    falls upon Idumea, or the world,--when the Lord pleads with all
    flesh by sword and by fire, and the slain of the Lord are many,
    the Saints may escape these calamities by fleeing to the places of
    refuge, like Lot and Noah.

    Isaiah, in his 24th chapter, gives something of an account of the
    calamities and judgments which shall come upon the heads of the
    Gentile nations, and this because they have transgressed the laws,
    changed the ordinance, and broken the everlasting covenant. The
    Apostle Paul says to his Roman brethren, that if the Gentiles do
    not continue in the {27} goodness of God, they, like the house of
    Israel, should be cut off. Though Babylon says, "I sit as a queen,
    and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow," the Revelator says,
    "Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning
    and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire, for strong
    is the Lord God who judgeth her."

    Jesus communicated the parable of the fig-tree, which in putting
    forth its leaves betokens the approach of summer; and so likewise,
    when we see the signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and in the
    heavens and the earth of which He spoke, we might know that His
    coming is near--that the generation in which those signs appeared
    should not pass away till all should be fulfilled.

    These things are about to come to pass upon the heads of the
    present generation, notwithstanding they are not looking for it,
    neither do they believe it. Yet their unbelief will not make the
    truth of God of none effect. The signs are appearing in the heavens
    and on the earth, and all things indicate the fulfillment of the
    Prophets. The fig-tree is leafing, summer is nigh, and the Lord has
    sent his angels to lay the foundation of this great and important
    work.

    Then why should not God reveal His secrets unto His servants the
    Prophets, that the Saints might be led in paths of safety, and
    escape those evils which are about to engulf a whole generation in
    ruin?

    _Monday,_ 11. Conference met at Boylston Hall at nine o'clock, a.m.
    Present of the quorum of the Twelve, Elders Brigham Young, Parley
    P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, George A.
    Smith, Heber C. Kimball, and Orson Hyde.

    Opened with prayer by Elder Page.

    Elder Brigham Young stated the object of the meeting. The first
    item of business is the spread of the Gospel of salvation. I want
    to state what devolves upon the Twelve. Nine years ago a revelation
    was given which was fulfilled in 1835; and when fulfilled,
    the Prophet lifted up his head and rejoiced before the Lord.
    Previously, the responsibility of spreading the Gospel rested on
    him; now it is on the Twelve. This is the relation we hold between
    the living and the dead--to direct how you may escape.

    Last winter we were directed to send men to the nations of the
    earth. Elder Addison Pratt had been to the Sandwich Islands, and
    proffered his services. We have power to ordain them, and call upon
    the Church to assist in sending them. Here are four men willing to
    go, and we do not wish them to cease trying, unless it be to die
    trying. One of them is ill. If he stays, he will die. I would go,
    or die trying.

    We call on the churches to fit out these men with necessaries.
    Elder Eli P. Maginn and Elder Philip B. Lewis we call on to fit
    them out. If {28} Elder Lewis does not, Maginn will do it himself.
    This takes the responsibility from us.

    If the Saints will not help, the curse of God will rest upon
    them. If the Temple at Nauvoo is not built, we will receive our
    endowments, if we have to go into the wilderness and build an altar
    of stone. If a man gives his all, it is all God requires. Brother
    Kimball has received one dollar since he came to Boston, and
    seventeen dollars and a half before, towards building the Temple. A
    book is kept of all sums given. This book will also be opened. All
    is recorded. I have received twenty-three dollars, and I have spent
    about forty-five or fifty dollars. I am rich, and expect to be so
    throughout all eternity, with the help of God and my brethren.
    I can get home, if I can sell land. Some of the Twelve are more
    destitute; but they are the best set of boys you ever saw.

    During the persecution in Missouri, when the mob came against Far
    West, Elder Kimball stood near me in one of the companies; and
    every time they formed, he rammed down another ball into his old
    musket, until he got five balls in. We are a good-feeling set of
    men, because of the Spirit which is in us. What produces it? The
    impulse of the heart. We should feel the same on the desert of
    Arabia, or on the islands of the sea; we feel happy wherever we
    are. When we ask for victuals, and get turned away, as we often
    have been, we feel just as well.

    The Spirit which is in me prompts me to look forward to something
    better. We have a prospect of selling shares of the Nauvoo House,
    and of obtaining subscriptions for the Temple, and we feel better.

    Here are twelve men, and I defy all creation to bring a charge of
    dishonesty against them. We had to give security for the faithful
    performance of our duty as agents for the Nauvoo House and Temple.
    This has been heretofore unheard of in the Church. I glory in it.
    The financial affairs of the Church rest on our shoulders, and
    God is going to whip us into it. When men are in future called to
    do like Brigham, I will be one to bind them; this is a precedent.
    We are the only legally authorized agents of the Church to manage
    affairs, give counsel to emigrants how to dispose of goods, &c.

    Some men come into this Church through designing purposes. Mr.
    Cowen, who lives about 30 miles above Nauvoo, wanted Brother
    Joseph to make a settlement at Shoquokon. Several of the brethren
    went there and preached, and some families moved up with the
    intention of settling. Mr. Cowen was all love--a charming fellow,
    and calculated to magnetize. He is now in the Eastern country, and
    going amongst the brethren. He gives one a kiss, and says he, "I
    am not a Mormon, but expect to be: Brother Joseph and myself are
    confidential friends. Can't you lend me five hundred dollars? I
    have got land, and I will give you {29} a mortgage." At the same
    time, he knew quite well that his land was in a perfect swamp, and
    that the place was not fit for a settlement. Even the captains of
    steamers could with difficulty be persuaded upon to call there,
    either on account of goods or passengers. His name is John F.
    Cowen, and he stands five feet six inches high. There are others.

    I would ask the Latter-day Saints, Do you know your benefactors?
    Do you know the source from whence you derive your knowledge? Take
    in the publications and periodicals of the Church. They give you
    intelligence of all matters pertaining to this dispensation with
    revelations for the guidance of the Church.

    I know that men who go through the world with the truth have
    not much influence; but let them come with silk velvet lips and
    sophistry, and they will have an influence. It is your privilege
    to be discerners of spirits. If you don't know me or the Twelve,
    walk with us fifty years, and perhaps you will know us then; and if
    such a man as Cowen comes along, will you trust him or me? No power
    can hide the heart from the discerning eye. If we are ignorant,
    what knowledge have the rest of the people? I sit down with all my
    ignorance, and read people's hearts as I see their faces, and they
    can't help themselves.

    No one has ever stepped aside but I have known it. I know the
    result of their actions, and they cannot help themselves. If you
    find out my heart, you are welcome to it. If any of the Twelve take
    a wrong path, or a course by themselves, I know the path, and know
    the end of it. They are soon in the ditch, crying for help. I sit
    down and let others run. I strike with a crooked stick to hit the
    whole.

    Now, the Twelve must be helped home, and there must be something
    for the Temple and the Nauvoo House. We have got a plot of the city
    of Nauvoo for lithographing. If any wish to advance the money to
    lithograph, and have a few thousands struck off, they shall be paid
    till they are satisfied. There was not wealth enough in New York
    and the regions round about. [He here exhibited the map of Nauvoo.]
    He concluded with a few remarks relative to the circumstances of
    Elder Hyde, who had just returned from his mission to Jerusalem.

    Elder Parley P. Pratt spoke as follows:--In the middle of last
    April I arrived at Nauvoo houseless and with a large family.
    Brother Joseph said to me, "Brother Parley, stay at home and
    build a house." I was behindhand in instructions and information,
    while others had been at home learning the great things of God. I
    have now come East principally on business, though I always have
    a mission, wherever I am. I speak for my brethren: they have an
    absolute claim; it belongs to them, and they want it. It is justly
    theirs. I ask for nothing for myself.

    Elder Heber C. Kimball said, I suppose you all understand what {30}
    Elder Young has said, and I consider his counsel good. He is my
    superior and my head in the council of the Twelve. If I go astray,
    it will be through ignorance. We must be subject to the powers
    that be; and there are no powers but what are ordained of God;
    and if we reject their counsel, we shall be damned. Some of our
    finest-looking and smartest men have fallen.

    I consider those trees in the forest which have the largest and
    highest tops are in the greatest danger: they are blown down;
    and there is no way of restoring them but to cut them off. Let
    the stump go back, and new sprouts come out. Those who have most
    responsibility are in most danger. We must be careful how we treat
    God's officers.

    No man ever fell, unless it was through rejecting counsel. I as
    well as my brethren see this. My superior knows more than I,
    because he is nearer the fountain. To get knowledge, begin at the
    foot of the stream, and drink all up till you get to the fountain,
    and then you get all the knowledge.

    It is necessary for the people here to obey counsel. God has sent
    me forth, through his servants, to take my part in this great work,
    and the work is true. I know there are but few in this Church
    who will be able to walk in this narrow path. We must keep the
    celestial law in the flesh. The more simple we teach, the better
    for us.

    It is a wrong idea of Elders whipping sects. Try and win the
    people; salt both sheep and shepherd too; get them up so that they
    will lick the salt out of your hands. [An infidel here handed money
    to Brother Kimball, who prophesied that he would be a Saint and an
    Elder, and all his family should be Saints.] Give them good salt,
    gain the affections of the shepherd, and the whole flock will come.
    Now, we get sheep up to lick; and when the old shepherd of the
    sheep comes up to lick salt, the Elders will hit him over the head
    with a cane. Their religion is as dear to them as ours to us. Don't
    feed too much salt at once, but give a little at a time, or they
    are cloyed.

    Elders of Israel, be wise! Give short discourses, as long ones cloy
    your hearers, who will say, "A good discourse, but I got tired."

    Never infringe on the right of other people, and never tear down
    other people's houses until you have built a better. We are sent
    to preach repentance, and let people alone. How do you like to go
    into other Churches and hear them abuse us? Do as you would be done
    by. Persuade men, and not compel them, unless the time spoken of by
    the Savior comes, when the Lord shall say unto His servants "Go out
    into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my
    house may be filled." (Luke 14 ch., 23-25.) Let men be humble, kind
    and affectionate.

1. William H. Folsom named above afterward became prominent as an
architect in Utah. He was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in March,
1815, and died in Salt Lake City, 1901, at the advanced age of 86
years. When a boy he moved to Buffalo N.Y. with his parents. When in
his twenty fifth year he heard a Mormon Elder preach and was converted
to the gospel and joined the Church. As a consequence of this act he
was ostracized by his people. He took his family and moved to Nauvoo
and established himself as an architect and builder, and assisted in
the construction of the Nauvoo Temple.

Brother Folsom was expelled from Nauvoo at the time of the general
exodus of the Saints and settled for a time at Keokuk. He subsequently
moved to Council Bluffs, and in 1860 went on to Salt Lake valley. His
ability as an architect and builder was soon required by President
Brigham Young. President Young conceived the general plan of the now
celebrated "Mormon Tabernacle" at Salt Lake City, but William Folsom
took President Young's suggestions and worked out the plans. While
others scouted the idea of the structure, Folsom had faith in it,
and as a consequence he has associated his name inseparably with the
building, that stands as one of the world's centers of interest and
curiosity. He was the architect and superintendent of construction of
the Manti Temple, and was an able assistant in the construction of all
the Temples in Utah. He was the designer of the Salt Lake Theater,
and of many other buildings that are this day admired for their
architectural grace and durability.

CHAPTER II.

MOVEMENTS OF APOSTLES IN THE EAST--THE NAUVOO MANSION--ROCKWELL
ACQUITTED--SPECIAL CONFERENCE AT NAUVOO--DISCOURSE OF THE PROPHET ON
THE DEMISE OF JAMES ADAMS.

[Sidenote: The Drought of 1843]

_Sunday, September 10, 1843_.--Cold, and considerable rain. Kindled
a fire in the office for the first time this fall. This is the first
rain of any consequence since the first of June. There have been
occasional--say three or four slight showers, but not enough to wet
the potato hills, and the vegetables in the gardens have generally
stopped growing, on account of the drought. Even corn is seriously
injured,--much of it by a worm in the ear. Early potatoes are scarcely
worth digging.

_Monday, 11_.--Early in the morning a petition was presented to me, as
Lieut.-General, to devise means to get the public arms of the State for
the Legion; whereupon I appointed William W. Phelps, Henry Miller, and
Hosea Stout a committee to wait on Governor Ford on the subject.

Election for probate justice; weather cold; people cold. Greenleaf
received most of the votes in Nauvoo--say seven hundred votes.

Six, p.m., I met with my Brother Hyrum, William Law, Newel K. Whitney,
and Willard Richards in my private room, where we had a season of
prayer for Brother Law's little daughter, who was sick, and Emma, who
was somewhat better.

_Tuesday, 12.--_Rainy day.

[Sidenote: Woodruff in a Train Wreck.]

{32} Elder Woodruff left Boston for Portland by railroad and while
passing through Chester woods, the engine was thrown off the tracks,
and with the baggage cars smashed to pieces. Several of the passenger
cars mounted the ruins, but none of the passengers were injured, except
two very slightly. The engineer, however, was killed instantaneously.
Elder Woodruff, with most of the passengers, remained all night in the
woods, and found it very cold.

_Wednesday, 13_.--I attended a lecture at the Grove, by Mr. John Finch,
a Socialist, from England, and said a few words in reply.

The following article appears [this day] in the _Neighbor_, copied from
The New Haven, Conn., _Herald_.--

    NAUVOO AND JOSEPH SMITH.

    A gentleman of this town, (New Haven, Conn.) of undoubted veracity,
    who has lately spent several weeks at Nauvoo and among the Mormons,
    informs us that the general impression abroad in regard to that
    place and people is very erroneous. During his residence there he
    became quite familiar with their manners, principles, and habits,
    and says there is not a more industrious, moral, and well-ordered
    town in the country. Society is as much diversified there as it is
    here, the Mormons constituting about two-thirds of the population,
    while all religious sects are as freely tolerated as in any other
    part of the State. He was at the late trial and acquittal of
    Joseph Smith, and says that the charges against him were of the
    most frivolous and unsubstantial nature. He [Joseph Smith] is an
    agreeable man in conversation, is respected by those who know
    him, and is 'as much sinned against as sinning.' He only claims
    the privilege of exercising and enjoying his own religion,--a
    privilege which he and his followers cheerfully award to others.
    They invite immigrants to come among them, and receive those who
    design to enter into the Mormon community with great attention
    and kindness. Houses are prepared for their reception, to which
    they are conducted on their arrival by a committee appointed for
    that purpose, whose next business is to attend to their immediate
    wants and see them comfortably situated. Education is by no
    means neglected, proper schools and teachers being provided, and
    temperance reigns throughout. It has now about 15,000 to 18,000
    inhabitants, and promises to become a place of extensive business,
    four or five steamboats stopping there every day. {33} The
    gentleman remarked to us that he wished he could speak as well of
    his own native town as he could of Nauvoo. This is news to us, as
    no doubt it will be to many; but no one who knows him can doubt the
    integrity of our informant.

[Sidenote: The Prophet on Socialism.]

_Thursday, 14.--_I attended a second lecture on Socialism, by Mr.
Finch; and after he got through, I made a few remarks, alluding
to Sidney Rigdon and Alexander Campbell getting up a community at
Kirtland, and of the big fish there eating up all the little fish. _I
said I did not believe the doctrine._

Mr. Finch replied in a few minutes, and said--"I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness. I am the spiritual Prophet--Mr. Smith the
temporal."

Elder John Taylor replied to the lecture at some length.

_Friday, 15._--I put up a sign,

"Nauvoo Mansion."

[Sidenote: "Nauvoo Mansion" Made a Hotel.]

In consequence of my house being constantly crowded with strangers and
other persons wishing to see me, of who had business in the city, I
found myself unable to support as much company free of charge, which I
have done from the foundation of the Church. My house has been a home
and resting-place for thousands, and my family many times obliged to do
without food, after having fed all they had to visitors; and I could
have continued the same liberal course, had it not been for the cruel
and untiring persecution of my relentless enemies. I have been reduced
to the necessity of opening "The Mansion" as a hotel. I have provided
the best table accommodations in the city; and the Mansion, being large
and convenient, renders travelers more comfortable than any other place
on the Upper Mississippi. I have erected a large and commodious brick
stable, and it is capable of accommodating seventy-five horses at one
time, and storing the requisite amount of forage, and is unsurpassed by
any similar establishment in the State.

There was an officers' drill in Nauvoo.

{34} Rhoda Ann, daughter of Willard and Jenetta Richards, was born at
fifteen minutes to three, p.m., in Nauvoo.

[Sidenote: Legion Parade and Inspection.]

_Saturday, 16.--_General parade of the Nauvoo Legion near my farm.
Went in company with my staff to the muster, was met by an escort, and
arrived before the Legion about noon. I was received and saluted with
military honors. The Legion was dismissed at about one, p.m., for two
hours, and I rode home to dinner. I returned about twenty minutes after
three, attended the review, and with my staff inspected the Legion;
after which, I took my post and gave orders.

After the inspection, I made a speech to the Legion on their increasing
prosperity, and requested the officers to increase the Legion in
numbers.

I was highly gratified with the officers and soldiers, and I felt
extremely well myself.

About sundown the Legion was dismissed. I rode home with my staff,
highly delighted with the day's performance, and well paid for my
services.

_Sunday, 17.--_I was at meeting; and while Elder Almon W. Babbitt was
preaching, I took my post as Mayor outside the assembly to keep order
and set an example to the other officers.

After preaching, I gave some instructions about order in the
congregation, men among women, and women among men, horses in the
assembly, and men and boys on the stand who do not belong there, &c.

In the evening Mr. Blodgett, a Unitarian minister, preached. I
was gratified with his sermon in general, but differed in opinion
on some points, on which I freely expressed myself to his great
satisfaction,--_viz._, on persecution making the work spread, like
rooting up a flower garden or kicking back the sun!

_Monday, 18.--_I received a letter from Governor Ford as follows:--

    {35} _Letter of Governor Ford to the Prophet._

    SPRINGFIELD, September 13, 1843.

    DEAR SIR,--In answer to your letter, I have the honor to reply,
    that I will consider it my duty to prevent the invasion of this
    State, if in my power, by any persons elsewhere for any hostile
    purposes whatever.

    From information in my possession, I am of opinion that there is
    but little danger of any such invasion. It is altogether more
    likely that some other mode of annoyance will be adopted. My
    enemies here, I think, are endeavoring to put something of the kind
    on foot.

    I am, most respectfully,

    Your obedient servant,

    THOMAS FORD.

I attended a council at my old house.

[Sidenote: Conference in Nova Scotia.]

A conference was held at Preston, Halifax County, Nova Scotia. 1 Elder,
1 Teacher, 1 Deacon, and 14 members were represented. Robert Dixon,
president; J. Jermen, clerk.

David Greenleaf was elected probate judge for the county of Hancock, by
a majority of 598 votes.

_Tuesday, 19.--_I directed Brother Phelps to answer the letter recently
received from the Governor, and to enclose a copy of the resolutions
passed at the meeting of the mobocracy at Carthage; which he did.

Wrote a letter to J. B. Backenstos.

A portion of the Twelve were present at a general muster of the
independent companies of Boston. Saw a sham battle, in which
thirty-five brass cannon were discharged seven times. One party was
commanded by the Governor of Mass., and the other by the officer next
in rank.

_Wednesday, 20.--_Visited my farm, accompanied by my Brother Hyrum.

The _Neighbor_ has the following:--

    PORTER ROCKWELL.

    A few short months ago, it was heralded through this State that
    Porter Rockwell was the individual who attempted to murder
    ex-Governor Boggs, of Missouri. It was confidently stated that
    Joseph Smith {36} was accessory before the fact. The thing was
    swallowed as a precious morsel by the enemies of Mormonism. It was
    iterated and reiterated by the public journals, and the general
    expression of a certain class was that Mr. Smith ought to be hung;
    there was no doubt of his guilt; he was one of the most inhuman,
    diabolical, dangerous, and malignant persons in the universe; and
    when a requisition was made for him by the Governor of Missouri,
    it was considered worse than "arson" or "treason" that he should
    be acquitted by the legal authorities of this State, under _habeas
    corpus;_ and afterwards, when Porter Rockwell was taken, it was
    exultingly stated that they had got the scoundrel, and that he
    would now receive the due demerit of his crime. How stands the
    matter when it is investigated--investigated by a Missouri court?
    The following will show:--

    The last _Independence Expositor_ says:--"Orin Porter Rockwell,
    the Mormon confined in our county jail, some time since, for the
    attempted assassination of ex-Governor Boggs, was indicted by
    our last grand jury for escaping from our county jail some time
    since, and sent to Clay county for trial. Owing, however, to some
    informality in the proceedings, he was remanded to this county
    again for trial. There was not sufficient proof adduced against him
    to predicate an indictment for shooting ex-Governor Boggs, and the
    grand jury therefore did not indict him for that offense."--[_St.
    Louis New Era_.]

    It appears, then, after all the bluster, the hue-and-cry about
    Mormon outrages, Mormon intrigue, "blood," "arson," and "murder,"
    that "there was not sufficient proof adduced against him to
    predicate an indictment for shooting ex-Governor Boggs, and the
    grand jury therefore did not indict him for that offense." This
    speaks for itself: it needs no comment. We are glad, for the sake
    of suffering innocence, that Mr. Rockwell stands clear in the eyes
    of the law. Thus it seems that after exerting all their malice and
    hellish rage to implicate the innocent, they can find no proof
    against him. But yet he must be again incarcerated, without proof,
    for another hearing. This is Missouri justice. If he was guilty
    of breaking jail, why not try and punish him for that before that
    court? Where is the necessity of remanding him to another county
    for another hearing? It is evident that they wish to immolate him,
    and, by offering him as a sacrifice, glut their thirst for innocent
    blood.

[Sidenote: Pacific Island Mission.]

I answered Governor Ford's letter received on the 18th. Elder Brigham
Young instructed Elder Addison Pratt to go and engage a passage for
himself and Elders Noah Rogers, Knowlton F. Hanks, and B. F. Grouard,
as missionaries to the Pacific Islands, {37} although they had not
one-tenth of the means on hand to pay their passage.

In the evening, Elders Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt,
Wilford Woodruff, George A. Smith, and John E. Page visited Mr. O.
S. Fowler, the phrenologist, who examined their heads and gave their
phrenological charts.

_Thursday, 21.--_Made affidavit with Willard Richards and William
Clayton to Auditor of State _v._ Walter Bagby.

About eleven, a.m., called with my Brother Samuel H. to see about
getting a copy of his blessing, and wished Doctor Richards much joy in
his new daughter.

About noon, went on board the _Maid of Iowa,_ with William Clayton,
clerk of the boat.

One, p.m., the thermometer stood at 100 deg. in the shade.

_Friday, 22.--_The Twelve visited the Navy Yard and Harbor of Boston,
the _Mississippi_ steamship, the ropewalk, the Bunker-hill monument,
the State-house, and the State's prison. In the evening they addressed
the Saints in Boylston Hall.

Elder Addison Pratt, accompanied by Elder Philip B. Lewis engaged a
passage to the Society Islands at $100 each for himself, Noah Rogers,
Knowlton F. Hanks, and B. F. Grouard.

_Saturday, 23.--_Elder Stephen Markham returned from Dixon, the trial
of Reynolds and Wilson being postponed till May next.

[Sidenote: Report from the Pinery.]

Bishop George Miller returned from the Pinery. He reports the water
in Black River so low that they could not get their raft into the
Mississippi.

I had an interview with Elder Orson Spencer, from whom I borrowed $75
for the Temple.

[Sidenote: Stewardship vs. Common Stock.]

_Sunday, 24.--_I preached on the stand about one hour on the 2nd
chapter of Acts, designing to show the folly of common stock. In Nauvoo
every {38} one is steward over his own. After preaching, I called
upon the brethren to draw stone for the Temple, and gave notice for a
special conference for the 6th of October next. Adjourned the meeting
about one, p.m., on account of the prospect of rain. Judge McBride and
a lawyer from Missouri were present at the meeting.

_Monday, 25.--_Wet day. At home. Held a conversation with the Missouri
lawyer.

_Tuesday, 26--_Held Mayor's Court, and tried the case of "Dana _v._
Leeches." No cause of action. Called at the store about six, p.m., and
directed the clerk to issue papers in the case of "Medagh _v._ Hovey."

_Wednesday, 27.--_The _Neighbor_ of this date has the following
editorial:--

    CONCERNING HORSE THIEVES.

    We find that the _Quincy Whig_ has some very righteous remarks to
    make concerning the Mormons, emanating from the purest principles
    of patriotism. (?) The editor has had some "_private_ conversation"
    with some individual or individuals about certain charges brought
    against the Mormons, particularly that of screening horse thieves.

    We think that the _Whig_ has not done itself much credit in
    advocating the principles contained in those resolutions. We leave
    that, however, for a discerning public to judge.

    Concerning the horse thieves, however, the informant of the _Whig_
    would have shown himself a better friend to society to have given
    information to the proper authorities, and had these pests of
    society brought to condign punishment. And the editor of that paper
    would have proved himself more patriotic by telling us who these
    people are that are screened in our midst, than dealing thus in
    generals and stabbing in the dark.

    Come, Mr. _Whig_, out with it, and let us know who it is that is
    found transgressing. Who knows but that, far fallen as we are,
    there yet may be virtue enough left to prosecute a horse thief!
    We have tried this more than once, and prosecuted them as far as
    Carthage; but no sooner do they arrive in the jail there than we
    lose all track of them. The lock of the door is so slippery, that
    it lets them all out. We presume, however, that it is on account
    of the honesty of the people. (?) We are pleased to find that the
    _Whig_ is in the secret!

    Mr. Ivins, of this city, had a horse stolen last week, and we
    frequently have occurrences of the kind. Will the editor of that
    paper be {39} so kind as to ask his informant who the thieves are,
    and where they live, and give us the desired information? and we
    shall esteem it a peculiar favor.

I was at home all day, and gave Brother Phelps the privilege of
occupying the small house near the store.

[Sidenote: Meeting of a Special Council.]

_Thursday, 28.--_At half-past eleven, a.m., a council convened over
the store, consisting of myself, my brother Hyrum, Uncle John Smith,
Newel K. Whitney, George Miller, Willard Richards, John Taylor, Amasa
Lyman, John M. Bernhisel, and Lucien Woodworth; and at seven in the
evening we met in the front upper room of the Mansion, with William Law
and William Marks. By the common consent and unanimous voice of the
council, I was chosen president of the special council.

The president led in prayer that his days might be prolonged until his
mission on the earth is accomplished, have dominion over his enemies,
all their households be blessed, and all the Church and the world.

_Friday, 29.--_Elder Brigham Young started from Boston for Nauvoo. The
Twelve were now scattered among the branches in the Eastern States.

_Saturday, 30.--_Rainy, and strong west wind.

Elders Young and Woodruff stayed at Elder Forster's, in New York.

_Sunday, October 1, 1843_.--I copy the following from the _Times and
Seasons_ of this date:--

    WHO SHALL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT?

    This question we frequently hear asked, and it is a question of no
    small importance to the Latter-day Saints.

    We, as a people, have labored and are still laboring under great
    injustice from the hands of a neighboring state. The Latter-day
    Saints have had their property destroyed, and their houses made
    desolate by the hands of the Missourians; murders have been
    committed with impunity, and many, in consequence of oppression,
    barbarism, and cruelty, have slept the sleep of death. They [the
    Saints] have been obliged to flee from their possessions into a
    distant land, in the chilling frosts of winter, robbed, spoiled,
    desolate, houseless, and homeless, without any just pretext {40} or
    shadow of law, without having violated the laws of that state, or
    the United States; and have had to wander as exiles in a strange
    land, without as yet being able to obtain any redress for their
    grievances.

    We have hitherto adopted every legal measure. First, we petitioned
    the State of Missouri, but in vain. We have memorialized Congress,
    but they have turned a deaf ear to our supplication, and referred
    us again to the State and _justice_ of Missouri. Doubtless many of
    the members of that honorable body were not sufficiently informed
    of the enormity and extent of the crimes of our persecutors, nor
    of the indelible stain which our national escutcheon has received
    through their inhuman daring. They have been allowed to revel in
    blood and luxuriate in the miseries of the oppressed, and no man
    has laid it to heart.

    The fact is that gentlemen of respectability and refinement, who
    live in a civilized society, find it difficult to believe that
    such enormities could be practiced in a Republican government.
    But our wrong cannot slumber. Such tyranny and oppression must
    not be passed over in silence. Our injuries, though past, are
    not forgotten by us; they still rankle in our bosoms, and the
    blood of the innocent yet cries for justice; and as American
    citizens we have appealed and shall still continue to appeal to
    the legally-constituted authorities of the land for redress, in
    the hopes that justice, which has long slumbered, may be aroused
    in our defense; that the spirit which burned in the bosoms of the
    patriots of '76 may fire the souls of their descendants; and though
    slow, that their indignation may yet be aroused at the injustice
    of the oppressor; and that they may yet mete out justice to our
    adversaries, and step forward in the defense of the innocent.

    We shall ask no one to commit themselves on our account. We want no
    steps taken but what are legal, constitutional and honorable. But
    we are_ American citizens;_ and as American citizens we have rights
    in common with all that live under the folds of the "star-spangled
    banner." Our rights have been trampled upon by lawless miscreants.
    We have been robbed of our liberties by mobocratic influence, and
    all those honorable ties that ought to govern and characterize
    Columbia's sons have been trampled in the dust. Still we are
    _American Citizens;_ and as American citizens we claim the
    privilege of being heard in the councils of our nation. We have
    been wronged, abused, robbed, and banished; and we seek redress.
    Such crimes can not slumber in Republican America. The cause of
    common humanity would revolt at it, and Republicanism would hide
    its head in disgust.

    We make these remarks for the purpose of drawing the attention
    of our brethren to this subject, both at home and abroad, that
    we may fix upon the man who will be the most likely to render us
    assistance in obtaining redress for our grievances; and not only
    give our own votes, but use our influence to obtain others; and if
    the voice of suffering innocence {41} will not sufficiently arouse
    the rulers of our nation to investigate our case, perhaps a vote
    of from fifty to one hundred thousand may rouse them from their
    lethargy.

    We shall fix upon the man of our choice, and notify our friends
    duly.

I published the following in the same number of the _Times and
Seasons:_--

    THE APPOINTMENT OF A MISSION TO RUSSIA.

    To all the Saints and honourable men of the earth to whom the Lord
    has given liberally of this world's goods, _greeting_:

    Our worthy Brother, Elder George J. Adams, has been appointed by
    the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints at Nauvoo to present to them the importance, as well as
    the things connected with his mission to Russia, to introduce the
    fullness of the Gospel to the people of that vast empire, and also
    to which is attached some of the most important things concerning
    the advancement and building up of the kingdom of God in the last
    days, which cannot be explained at this time. But as the mission is
    attended with much expense, all those who feel disposed to bestow
    according as God has blessed them shall receive the blessings of
    Israel's God, and tenfold shall be added unto them, as well as the
    prayers of the Saints of God.

    With sentiments of high esteem, we subscribe ourselves your friends
    and brethren in the now and everlasting covenant,

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    HYRUM SMITH.

    Presidents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. [1]

I attended meeting this morning, and adjourned it in consequence of the
cold and rain. The afternoon being more pleasant, the people assembled,
and were addressed by Elders Marks, Charles C. Rich and Bishop Jacob
Foutz.

Council met in the evening same as on Thursday previous.

_Monday, 2.--_At home.

[Sidenote: Movement of Apostles in the East.]

_Tuesday, 3.--_Elders Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde,
George A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff, and Jedediah M. Grant spent the day
in visiting the Saints in Philadelphia. In the evening they partook of
an oyster supper, on the invitation of Mr. Jeffreys.

{42} The brethren assembled with their wives, to the number of about
one hundred couple, and dined at the Mansion as an opening to the
house. A very pleasant day, and all things passed off well.

The following is extracted from the _Neighbor_ of this date.

    PLEASURE PARTY AND DINNER AT THE NAUVOO MANSION.

    General Joseph Smith, the proprietor of said house, provided a
    luxurious feast for a pleasure party; and all having partaken of
    the luxuries of a well-spread board, the cloth was removed, and a
    committee appointed to draft resolutions suitable to the occasion.
    They adjourned for a few moments and returned, when Robert D.
    Foster was appointed chairman.

    The object of the meeting was then briefly stated by the chairman;
    after which a hymn was sung, and prayer by Elder Taylor. The
    chairman then arose and made some appropriate remarks for the
    occasion, touching upon the rise and progress of the city,
    the varied scenes through which the Saints had to pass, the
    persecutions and abuses the Prophets had to undergo, &c., &c. After
    which he read the following resolutions and toast, which were
    unanimously adopted:--

    Resolved, 1st. That a vote of thanks be presented to General Joseph
    Smith and lady, through the medium of the _Nauvoo Neighbor,_ for
    the very bountiful feast by them provided, for the accommodation of
    this party of more than one hundred couple at their Mansion.

    Resolved, 2nd. General Joseph Smith, whether we view him as a
    Prophet at the head of the Church, a General at the head of the
    Legion, a Mayor at the head of the City Council, or as a landlord
    at the head of his table, if he has equals, he has no superiors.

    Resolved, 3rd. Nauvoo, the great emporium of the West, the center
    of all centers, a city of three years' growth, a population of
    15,000 souls congregated from the four quarters of the globe,
    embracing the intelligence of all nations, with industry,
    frugality, economy, virtue, and brotherly love, unsurpassed by any
    age in the world,--a suitable home for the Saints.

    Resolved, 4th. Nauvoo Legion, a well disciplined and faithful band
    of invincibles, ready at all times to defend their country with
    this motto, "Vive la Republique."

    Resolved, 5th. Nauvoo Charter, like the laws of the Medes and
    Persians, an unalterable decree by a patriotic band of wise
    legislators for the protection of the innocent.

    Resolved, 6th. Thomas Ford, Governor of Illinois, fearless and {43}
    faithful in the discharge of all official duties,--long may he
    live, and blessings attend his administration.

    Colonel Francis M. Higbee was then called to the stand, who
    addressed the audience in a very spirited and appropriate manner
    for the day.

    Professor Orson Spencer was then called, who arose, and in his
    usual easy and eloquent manner highly entertained the company for
    nearly half-an-hour.

    The next called was Elder John Taylor, who alone was capable of
    putting on the top stone of the entertainment. His address was
    highly interesting, combining, like a Lacoon, a volume in every
    gesture.

    General Smith then arose, and, in a very touching and suitable
    manner, tendered his thanks to the company for the encomiums and
    honors conferred on him. He recited the many woes through which
    he had passed, the persecutions which he had suffered, and the
    love he had for the brethren and citizens of Nauvoo. He tendered
    his gratitude for the pleasing prospects that surrounded him to
    the great Giver of all good. He said he thought that his case was
    similar to that of old Job's--that after he had suffered and drank
    the very dregs of affliction, the Lord had remembered him in mercy,
    and was about to bless him abundantly.

    After he had done, Mrs. Emma Smith presented her thanks, through
    the chair, to the company present; after which, a motion was made
    and carried, to adjourn, whereupon the company were called to their
    feet. Benediction by Elder Taylor, and the party retired with the
    most perfect satisfaction and good humor as was ever witnessed on
    such occasions.

    ROBERT D. FOSTER, Chairman.

In the evening Mr. William Backenstos and Clara M. Wasson were married
at the Mansion. I solemnized the marriage in presence of a select party.

_Wednesday, 4.--_I extract the following from the _Neighbor_ of this
date:--

    ANTI-MORMONISM.

    With respect to the Carthage meeting, I take upon myself to deny
    the charges _in toto,_ and challenge them to the proof. If we
    harbor horse-thieves among us, as is basely asserted, let the
    man that has lost his horse publish his name and the name of the
    villain, or how he knows him to be a Mormon, and where he is
    harbored, that we may have something more than vague assertions.
    They well know that no such proof can be produced, but that the
    charges had their birth in the minds of one or two heartless
    scoundrels thirsting for revenge for their late disappointments.
    The whole of the charges are a tissue of falsehoods {44} got up
    with the idea of intimidating a peaceable body of citizens. But,
    sir, we set such designing knaves at defiance and laugh at their
    threats, treating them with utter contempt, but ever ready to abide
    by the truth.

    JOHN GREENHOW.

Elder Reuben Hedlock wrote the following letter:--

    _Elder Reuben Hedlock to the First Presidency._

    LIVERPOOL, October 4, 1843.

    _To the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,
    greeting:--_

    DEAR AND MUCH ESTEEMED BRETHREN,--I hasten to inform you of my
    arrival in Liverpool on the 30th day of September, in company
    with Elders John Cairns, James Sloan and wife, James Houston, and
    William G. Jermon. We left six of the Twelve in the city of New
    York, the 2nd day of September, and came on board of the ship
    _Columbus_. Our passage money was five dollars. We had a very hard
    passage. We were very much crowded in the steerage. There were 236
    persons--Dutch, Irish, English and Scotch, and as dirty as any I
    ever saw. We were not much sick; the weather was cold. Had it been
    otherwise, we should have suffered more. A steamer leaves for New
    York today, and I thought I would announce to you my arrival by
    this opportunity, and such information as I was in possession of up
    to this date. There is a ship to sail on the 14th instant, by which
    I shall write you again.

    I found Elders Hyrum Clark, Thomas Ward, and Amos Fielding in
    Liverpool, and they were well; and as far as I was informed by
    them, the Church is in a good state and on the increase; it numbers
    somewhere between eight and nine thousand members. There is a great
    want of laborers in the vineyard. Many of the first Elders have
    left this for Nauvoo, leaving their places vacant. I presented
    to the Presidency here your decision relative to the printing.
    Elders Ward and Fielding received it, and manifested a desire to
    abide by it. Elder Fielding wept when I showed him your decision
    concerning him and his coming to Nauvoo by the first ship to see
    you face to face. The brethren say here that he has been too hasty
    in some things, and has given some an offense; but I do not as yet
    know anything derogatory to his character that I could say aught
    against him. I shall write you all the particulars as fast as I
    come in possession of them. As regards the printing in this land,
    we shall stop it after the next number is published. In it we wish
    to publish the news from Nauvoo for the benefit of the Saints, and
    to announce our arrival in this country.

    Permit me here to give you my opinion as regards the printing in
    this land, and I will cheerfully abide your advice notwithstanding.
    After we stop the _Star_, we shall have during the shipping season
    to advertise {45} and give general information in the emigration
    business to the Saints scattered abroad. I think it would be
    best to republish the _Times and Seasons_ for the benefit of the
    Church. The duties on books are £2-10s. per hundredweight; and
    there are now 1,600 _Stars_ circulated here at the present, and
    the demands of our publications are on the increase. The duties
    would almost reprint the _Times and Seasons,_ and then we could do
    our advertising on the last page, if thought advisable. We could
    afford it as cheap as the present _Star_, and pay you something for
    the privilege of publishing, as well as to pay it to the crown. I
    have not yet learned the amount of funds remaining here subject to
    your order. I have not had much time as yet to inquire into those
    matters, in consequence of the multitude of business in unloading
    our freight from shipboard.

    The brethren that came with me wish to say to those whom it may
    concern, that they are well, and will in a few days leave for their
    fields of labor.

    I shall write to you once a month, no preventing Providence, and
    should be glad to have you write to me as often, and give me your
    advice and counsel relating to those things you, in your wisdom,
    may think beneficial to the Saints and emigration in this land.

    I wish Elder Taylor would forward to me the amount of the number
    that will make the volume of the _Times and Seasons_ complete by
    the first opportunity. By so doing I can sell the 200 volumes to
    advantage. I will try to forward to him what I can obtain for the
    _Times and Seasons_ already here. If it should be thought wisdom to
    reprint the _Times and Seasons_ here, I wish Brother Taylor would
    be particular to send, so that we could obtain them, if possible.
    I am informed by Elder Ward that they have not received any
    intelligence from you since last February.

    I wish you would write me your mind concerning the printing
    immediately on the receipt of this sheet, so that our communication
    with the Saints in England may not be stopped long.

    I am, as ever, your humble servant in the bonds of the new and
    everlasting covenant,

    REUBEN HEDLOCK.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's visit with Justin Butterfield.]

I was at the mansion preparing some legal papers.--Justin Butterfield,
Esq., U. S. Attorney for Illinois, arrived this afternoon; and I spent
the rest of the day in riding and chatting with him.

Council of the quorum [special council, see p. 39] met and adjourned to
Sunday evening; my Brother Hyrum's child being sick.

{46} The quorum of the Twelve started from Philadelphia for Pittsburgh.

_Thursday, 5.--_This morning I rode out with Esquire Butterfield to the
farm.

[Sidenote: Instructions Respecting Plurality of Wives.]

In the afternoon, rode to the prairie to show some of the brethren
some land. Evening, at home, and walked up and down the streets with
my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching,
teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives: for,
according to the law, I hold the keys of this power in the last days;
for there is never but one on earth at a time on whom the power and its
keys are conferred; _and I have constantly said no man shall have but
one wife at a time, unless the Lord directs otherwise._

_Friday, 6.--_I attended special conference; but as few people
were out, in consequence of the weather proving unfavorable, the
organization of the conference was adjourned until to morrow, or the
first pleasant day.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Dissatisfaction with Sidney Rigdon.]

After giving notice that President Rigdon's case would be considered,
&c., I walked towards home, and gave instructions to my scribe to cause
all the papers relating to my land-claims in the Half Breed Tract in
Iowa, to be placed in the hands of Esquire Butterfield.

_Saturday, 7.--_I attended conference.

_Sunday, 8.--_Slight frost last night. Conference convened in the
morning; but, as it rained, adjourned till Monday at ten, a.m.

Prayer-meeting at my house in the evening. Quorum present; also, in
addition, Sisters Adams, Elizabeth Ann Whitney, my aunt Clarissa Smith,
and my mother.

My brother Hyrum and his wife were blessed, ordained and anointed.

The Twelve arrived at Pittsburgh at ten, a.m., and again left by the
steamer _Raritan,_ at eleven, a.m., _en route_ for Nauvoo.

{47} _Monday, 9.--_Attended conference, and preached a funeral sermon
on the death of General James Adams; a brief synopsis of which, as
reported by Dr. Willard Richards, will be found in the minutes below.

I here insert the conference minutes.

    MINUTES OF A SPECIAL CONFERENCE.

    _The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Special
    Conference, held in the City of Nauvoo, commencing on the 6th of
    October, 1843._

    Friday, October 6, ten o'clock, a.m.

    The weather proving unfavorable, the organization of the Conference
    was postponed until the next day at ten o'clock, a.m.

    Saturday, ten o'clock, a.m.

    Conference assembled and proceeded to business.

    President Joseph Smith was called to the chair, and Gustavus Hills
    was chosen clerk.

    Singing by the choir, and prayer by Elder Almon W. Babbitt.

    The president stated the items of business to be brought before the
    conference to be--

    1st. The case and standing of Elder Sidney Rigdon, Counselor in the
    First Presidency.

    2nd. The further progress of the Temple; after which, any
    miscellaneous business.

    Elder Sidney Rigdon addressed the conference on the subject of his
    situation and circumstances among the Saints.

    President Joseph Smith addressed the conference, inviting an
    expression of any charges or complaints which the conference had to
    make. He stated his dissatisfaction with Elder Sidney Rigdon as a
    Counselor, not having received any material benefit from his labors
    of counsels since their escape from Missouri. Several complaints
    were then brought forward in reference to his management in the
    post office; a supposed correspondence and connection with John C.
    Bennett, with Ex-Governor Carlin, and with the Missourians, of a
    treacherous character; also his leaguing with dishonest persons in
    endeavoring to defraud the innocent.

    President Joseph Smith related to the conference the detention of
    a document from Justin Butterfield, Esq., which was designed for
    the benefit of himself, (President Smith,) but was not handed over
    for some three or four weeks, greatly to his disadvantage; also,
    an indirect testimony from Missouri, through the mother of Orrin
    P. Rockwell, that said Rigdon and others had given information,
    by letter, of President Smith's visit to Dixon, advising them to
    proceed to that place {48} and arrest him there. He stated that, in
    consequence of these and other circumstances, and Elder Rigdon's
    unprofitableness to him as a Counselor, he did not wish to retain
    him in that station, unless those difficulties could be removed;
    but desired his salvation, and expressed his willingness that he
    should retain a place among the Saints.

    Elder Almon W. Babbitt suggested the propriety of limiting the
    complaints and proofs to circumstances that had transpired since
    the last conference.

    President Joseph Smith replied, and showed the legality and
    propriety of a thorough investigation, without such limitation.

    Elder Sidney Rigdon pleaded, concerning the document from Justin
    Butterfield, Esq., that he received it in answer to some inquiries
    which he [Rigdon] had transmitted to him [Butterfield]; that he
    [Rigdon] received it at a time when he was sick, and unable to
    examine it; did not know that it was designed for the perusal and
    benefit of President Joseph Smith; that he had, consequently,
    ordered it to be laid aside, where it remained until inquired for
    by Joseph Smith. He had never written to Missouri concerning the
    visit of Joseph Smith to Dixon, and knew of no other person having
    done so. That, concerning certain rumors of belligerent operations
    under Governor Carlin's administration, he had related them, not
    to alarm or disturb any one; but that he had the rumors from good
    authorities, and supposed them well founded. That he had never
    received but one communication from John C. Bennett, and that of
    a business character, except one addressed to him conjointly with
    Elder Orson Pratt, which he handed over to President Smith. That he
    had never written any letters to John C. Bennett.

    The weather becoming inclement, conference adjourned until Sunday,
    ten o'clock, a.m.

    Sunday, 8th, ten o'clock, A.M.

    Conference assembled agreeably to adjournment.

    Singing by the choir, and prayer by Elder William W. Phelps.

    Elder Sidney Rigdon resumed his plea of defense. He related the
    circumstances of his reception in the city of Quincy, after his
    escape from Missouri,--the cause of his delay in not going to the
    city of Washington, on an express to which he had been appointed:
    and closed with a moving appeal to President Joseph Smith,
    concerning their former friendship, associations, and sufferings;
    and expressed his willingness to resign his place, though with
    sorrowful and indescribable feelings. During this address, the
    sympathies of the congregation were highly excited.

    Elder Almon W. Babbitt related a conversation he had had with
    Esquire Johnson, in which he exonerated Elder Sidney Rigdon
    from the {49} charge or suspicion of having had a treacherous
    correspondence with ex-Governor Carlin.

    President Joseph Smith arose and explained to the congregation
    the supposed treacherous correspondence with ex-Governor Carlin,
    and expressed entire lack of confidence in his integrity and
    steadfastness, judging from their past intercourse.

    Patriarch Hyrum Smith followed with appropriate and impressive
    remarks on the attributes of mercy in God, as that by which He
    influences, controls and conquers; and the propriety and importance
    of the Saints exercising the same attribute towards their fellows,
    and especially towards their aged companion and fellow-servant in
    the cause of truth and righteousness.

    Elder Almon W. Babbitt and President William Law followed with
    remarks in defense of Elder Sidney Rigdon.

    On motion by President William Marks, and seconded by Patriarch
    Hyrum Smith, conference voted that Elder Sidney Rigdon be permitted
    to retain his station as Counselor in the First Presidency.

    _President Joseph Smith arose and said, "I have thrown him off my
    shoulders, and you have again put him on me. You may carry him, but
    I will not_." [2]

    Singing. Prayer by Elder William Law.

    Conference adjourned for one hour.

    Three, p.m.

    Conference assembled; but in consequence of the inclemency of the
    weather, business was postponed until Monday, ten o'clock, A.M.

    Monday, ten o'clock, a.m.

    Conference assembled, and resumed business.

    Singing by the choir. Prayer by Elder Alpheus Cutler.

    The business pertaining to the Temple was then announced by the
    President as next in order.

    Elder Alpheus Cutler, on the part of the Temple Committee,
    represented the work of the Temple to be retarded for want of team
    work and provisions--also of iron, steel, blasting powder, and
    clothing,--giving as his opinion that the walls could easily be
    completed next season, if these embarrassments were removed, and
    the brethren would come forward to sustain them in the work with
    the means that were in their hands.

    Elder Reynolds Cahoon followed, seconding the remarks of Elder
    Cutler, and setting forth the importance of the Saints using their
    utmost exertions to fulfill the revelation concerning the Temple,
    earnestly exhorting the Saints here and abroad to roll in the
    necessary means into the hands of the Trustee, that the work may
    advance with rapidity.

    {50} President Hyrum Smith followed with pertinent remarks on the
    importance of the work--the ease with which it might be advanced
    to its completion,--that it had already become a monument for the
    people abroad to gaze on with astonishment. He concluded with some
    advice to parents to restrain their children from vice and folly,
    and employ them in some business of profit to themselves, to the
    Temple, or elsewhere.

    On motion by Elder William Law, and seconded by President Hyrum
    Smith, conference voted that we, as a conference and individuals,
    will use all the means, exertions, and influence in our power to
    sustain the Temple Committee in advancing the work of the Temple.

    Conference adjourned for one hour.

    Two o'clock, p.m.

    Conference re-assembled, and listened with profound attention to
    an impressive discourse from President Joseph Smith, commemorative
    of the decease of James Adams, Esq., late of this city, and an
    honorable, worthy, useful and esteemed member of the Church of
    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

    THE PROPHET'S REMARKS ON THE DEMISE OF JAMES ADAMS.

    All men know that they must die. And it is important that we
    should understand the reasons and causes of our exposure to the
    vicissitudes of life and of death, and the designs and purposes
    of God in our coming into the world, our sufferings here, and our
    departure hence. What is the object of our coming into existence,
    then dying and falling away, to be here no more? It is but
    reasonable to suppose that God would reveal something in reference
    to the matter, and it is a subject we ought to study more than
    any other. We ought to study it day and night, for the world is
    ignorant in reference to their true condition and relation. If
    we have any claim on our Heavenly Father for anything, it is for
    knowledge on this important subject. Could we read and comprehend
    all that has been written from the days of Adam, on the relation of
    man to God and angels in a future state, we should know very little
    about it. Reading the experience of others, or the revelation
    given to _them,_ can never give _us_ a comprehensive view of our
    condition and true relation to God. Knowledge of these things can
    only be obtained by experience through the ordinances of God set
    forth for that purpose. Could you gaze into heaven five minutes,
    you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was
    written on the subject.

    We are only capable of comprehending that certain things exist,
    which we may acquire by certain fixed principles. If men would
    acquire salvation, they have got to be subject, before they leave
    this {51} world, to certain rules and principles, which were fixed
    by an unalterable decree before the world was.

    The disappointment of hopes and expectations at the resurrection
    would be indescribably dreadful.

    The organization of the spiritual and heavenly worlds, and of
    spiritual and heavenly beings, was agreeable to the most perfect
    order and harmony: their limits and bounds were fixed irrevocably,
    and voluntarily subscribed to in their heavenly estate by
    themselves, and were by our first parents subscribed to upon
    the earth. Hence the importance of embracing and subscribing to
    principles of eternal truth by all men upon the earth that expect
    eternal life.

    I assure the Saints that truth, in reference to these matters,
    can and may be known through the revelations of God in the way of
    His ordinances, and in answer to prayer. The Hebrew Church "came
    unto the spirits of just men made perfect, and unto an innumerable
    company of angels, unto God the Father of all, and to Jesus Christ,
    the Mediator of the new covenant." What did they learn by coming of
    the spirits of just men made perfect? Is it written? No. What they
    learned has not been and could not have been written. What object
    was gained by this communication with the spirits of the just? It
    was the established order of the kingdom of God: the keys of power
    and knowledge were with them to communicate to the Saints. Hence
    the importance of understanding the distinction between the spirits
    of the just and angels.

    Spirits can only be revealed in flaming fire or glory. Angels have
    advanced further, their light and glory being tabernacled; and
    hence they appear in bodily shape. The spirits of just men are made
    ministering servants to those who are sealed unto life eternal, and
    it is through them that the sealing power comes down.

    Patriarch Adams is now one of the spirits of the just men made
    perfect; and, if revealed now, must be revealed in fire; and the
    glory could not be endured. Jesus showed Himself to His disciples,
    and they thought it was His spirit, and they were afraid to
    approach His spirit. Angels have advanced higher in knowledge and
    power than spirits.

    Concerning Brother James Adams, it should appear strange that so
    good and so great a man was hated. The deceased ought never to
    have had an enemy. But so it was. Wherever light shone, it stirred
    up darkness. Truth and error, good and evil cannot be reconciled.
    Judge Adams had some enemies, but such a man ought not to have had
    one. I saw him first at Springfield, when on my way from Missouri
    to Washington. He sought me out when a stranger, took me to his
    home, encouraged and cheered me, and gave me money. He has been a
    most intimate friend. I anointed him to the patriarchal power--to
    receive {52} the keys of knowledge and power, by revelation to
    himself. He has had revelations concerning his departure, and has
    gone to a more important work. When men are prepared, they are
    better off to go hence. Brother Adams has gone to open up a more
    effectual door for the dead. The spirits of the just are exalted
    to a greater and more glorious work; hence they are blessed in
    their departure to the world of spirits. Enveloped in flaming fire,
    they are not far from us, and know and understand our thoughts,
    feelings, and motions, and are often pained therewith.

    Flesh and blood cannot go there; but flesh and bones, quickened by
    the Spirit of God, can.

    If we would be sober and watch in fasting and prayer, God would
    turn away sickness from our midst.

    Hasten the work in the Temple, renew your exertions to forward
    all the work of the last days, and walk before the Lord in
    soberness and righteousness. Let the Elders and Saints do away with
    lightmindedness, and be sober.

    Such is a faint outline of the discourse of President Joseph
    Smith, which was delivered with his usual feeling and pathos, and
    was listened to with the most profound and eager attention by the
    multitude, who hung upon his instructions, anxious to learn and
    pursue the path of eternal life.

    After singing by the choir, and prayer by the President, Conference
    adjourned _sine die,_ with the benediction of the President.

    JOSEPH SMITH, President.

ANCIENT RUINS IN AMERICA, BOOK OF MORMON EVIDENCE--THE PROPHET ON THE
U. S. CONSTITUTION AND THE BIBLE--MISREPRESENTATIONS CORRECTED--LETTER
TO THE U. S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES--THE PROPHET'S ADDRESS TO THE
SAINTS.

_Tuesday, October 10, 1843.--_My brother Hyrum was appointed, by the
voice of the Spirit, one of the Temple Committee, in place of Judge
Elias Higbee, deceased.

I spent the day in council with J. and O. C. Skinner and the Rhodes'
about the sale of land, and appointed William Clayton to buy the
property.

_Wednesday, 11--_I was at home this morning. In the afternoon I went
with my brother Hyrum, William Law, and our wives, to Brother John
Benbow's.

The following is from the _Times and Seasons_:--

    ANCIENT RUINS--INTRODUCTORY.

    Every day adds fresh testimony to the already accumulated evidence
    on the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. At the time that book
    was translated, there was very little known about ruined cities
    and dilapidated buildings. The general presumption was that no
    people possessing more intelligence than our present race of
    Indians had ever inhabited this continent; and the accounts given
    in the Book of Mormon concerning large cities and civilized
    people having inhabited this land were generally disbelieved and
    pronounced a humbug. Priest, since then, has thrown some light on
    this interesting subject. [Stephens, in his "Incidents of Travels
    in Central America," has thrown in a flood of testimony, and from
    the following statements it is evident that the Book of Mormon does
    not give a more extensive account of large and populous cities than
    those discovered demonstrate to be even now in existence.--Ed.]

    _(Article from the Texas Telegraph, October 11.)_

    We have been informed by a gentleman who has traversed a large
    portion of the Indian country of Northern Texas, and the country
    {54} lying between Santa Fe and the Pacific, that there are
    vestiges of ancient cities and ruined castles or temples on the Rio
    Puerco, and on the Colorado of the West.

    He says that on one of the branches of the Rio Puerco, a few days'
    travel from Santa Fe, there is an immense pile of ruins that
    appear to belong to an ancient temple. Portions of the walls are
    still standing, consisting of huge blocks of limestone regularly
    hewn and laid in cement. The building occupies an extent of more
    than an acre. It is two or three stories high, has no roof, but
    contains many rooms, generally of a square form, without windows;
    and the lower rooms are so dark and gloomy that they resemble
    caverns rather than the apartments of an edifice built for a human
    habitation.

    Our informant did not give the style of architecture, but he
    believes it could not be erected by Spaniards or Europeans, as the
    stones are much worn by the rains, and indicate that the building
    has stood many hundred years. From his description, we are induced
    to believe that it resembles the ruins of Palenque or Otulum.

    He says there are many similar ruins on the Colorado of the West,
    which empties in the Californian sea. In one of the valleys of
    the Cordilleras traversed by this river, and about four hundred
    miles from its mouth, there is a large temple still standing, its
    walls and spires presenting scarcely any traces of dilapidation;
    and were it not for the want of a roof, it might still be rendered
    habitable. Near it, scattered along the declivity of a mountain,
    are the ruins of what must have been once a large city.

    The traces of a large aqueduct, part of which is, however, in the
    solid rock, are still visible. Neither the Indians residing in the
    vicinity nor the oldest Spanish settlers of the nearest settlements
    can give any account of the origin of these buildings. They merely
    know that they have stood there from the earliest periods to which
    their traditions extend.

    The antiquarian who is desirous to trace the Aztec or the Toltec
    races in their migrations from the northern regions of America may
    find in their ancient edifices many subjects of curious speculation.

_Thursday, 12.--_Prayer-meeting in my room. We prayed for William
Marks, who was sick.

I sent William Clayton to Lathrop, to borrow $50, that I might be able
to redeem $5000 worth of property, which was published to be sold today
at Rhodes'; but Lathrop refused. He also went to Eli Chase's, but was
refused by him. I was grieved that the brethren felt so penurious
in their spirit, although they professed to be guided by the {55}
revelations which the Lord gives through me. On my afterwards giving a
pledge that I would repay the $50 in forty-eight hours, Lathrop lent
the money and enabled me to redeem the land.

I received the following from H. R. Hotchkiss:

    _Letter--H. R. Hotchkiss to Joseph Smith._

    NEW YORK, 27th September, 1843.

    _Rev. Joseph Smith._

    DEAR SIR,--I see by the newspapers that there has been a meeting
    of citizens at Carthage relative to the Mormons, and that several
    severe resolutions have been passed condemning the conduct of the
    Mormons. Knowing how little I can rely upon public rumor upon such
    subjects, I have taken the liberty of applying directly to you for
    correct information, and solicit as a particular favor that you
    will communicate at your earliest convenience the facts in the case.

    Of course I feel an interest in the prosperity of Nauvoo, and
    an interest also in the success of the Mormon enterprise, and a
    deep interest in the welfare of your people; and the more so,
    certainly, as their pecuniary interest is identified with my own. I
    make this frank acknowledgment, because it is always best for men
    of sense to talk as they mean. I should, however, be solicitous
    for a successful termination of your great enterprise, had I not
    one dollar invested in Nauvoo, because the complete triumph of
    energetic exertions is always gratifying to all business men.

    Your obedient servant,

    HORACE R. HOTCHKISS.

I wrote this reply:--

    _Letter--Joseph Smith to H. R. Hotchkiss._

    NAUVOO, Ill., Oct. 12, 1843.

    DEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 27th ult. is at hand, soliciting
    information concerning the "Carthage resolutions." In answer to
    your very candid inquiry and interest relative to our welfare,
    brevity will suffice. Unprincipled men and disappointed demagogues,
    with here and there an "untamed sucker," composed that disgraceful
    and disgracing as well as mobocratic assemblage; and I feel proud
    to say that patriots and honest men generally frown upon such
    audacious proceedings as beneath the dignity of freemen. It is to
    be hoped that public opinion will continue to spurn at such doings,
    and leave the actors to fester in their own shame.

    With the smiling prospects around us at present, success seems {56}
    certain; and, with the blessings of Jehovah, we shall reap the
    reward of virtue and goodness. I go for the good of the world; and
    if all honest men would do so, mean men would be scarce. You are at
    liberty to use this to counteract falsehoods as you may deem proper.

    Respectfully, I am your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

_Friday, 13.--_First severe frost at Nauvoo this season. Ice on the
water.

At home; made arrangements to prepare provisions for the workmen in the
pinery. From ten, a.m. to three, p.m., presided in municipal court, on
_habeas corpus_ in favor of Charles Drown, to be delivered from the
custody of Samuel Waterman. The prisoner being sick, adjourned the case
to the 16th.

In the afternoon, trying a span of grey horses in the carriage.

Dr. Turner, a phrenologist, came in. I gratified his curiosity for
about an hour by allowing him to examine my head.

I was engaged settling accounts with D. S. Hollister.

_Saturday, 14.--_In the morning, at home, having a long [Location of
the mind.] conversation with a physiologist and mesmerizer. I asked
them to prove that the mind of man was seated in one part of the brain
more than another.

Sat in City Council till one, p.m., which passed "An Ordinance
concerning the inspection of flour," and appointed William E. Horner
inspector of flour for the city of Nauvoo.

_Sunday, 15.--_Cool, calm, and cloudy. At eleven, a.m., I preached at
the stand east of the Temple. The following synopsis was reported by
Dr. Willard Richards:--

    _The Prophet on the Constitution of the United States and the
    Bible--Temporal Economies._

    It is one of the first principles of my life, and one that I have
    cultivated from my childhood, having been taught it by my father,
    to allow every one the liberty of conscience. I am the greatest
    advocate of the {57} Constitution of the United States there is
    on the earth. In my feelings I am always ready to die for the
    protection of the weak and oppressed in their just rights. The only
    fault I find with the Constitution is, it is not broad enough to
    cover the whole ground.

    Although it provides that all men shall enjoy religious freedom,
    yet it does not provide the manner by which that freedom can be
    preserved, nor for the punishment of Government officers who refuse
    to protect the people in their religious rights, or punish those
    mobs, states, or communities who interfere with the rights of the
    people on account of their religion. Its sentiments are good, but
    it provides no means of enforcing them. It has but this one fault.
    Under its provision, a man or a people who are able to protect
    themselves can get along well enough; but those who have the
    misfortune to be weak or unpopular are left to the merciless rage
    of popular fury.

    The Constitution should contain a provision that every officer
    of the Government who should neglect or refuse to extend the
    protection guaranteed in the Constitution should be subject to
    capital punishment; and then the president of the United States
    would not say, _"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for
    you,"_ a governor issue exterminating orders, or judges say, "The
    men ought to have the protection of law, but it won't please
    the mob; the men must die, anyhow, to satisfy the clamor of the
    rabble; they must be hung, or Missouri be damned to all eternity."
    Executive writs could be issued when they ought to be, and not be
    made instruments of cruelty to oppress the innocent, and persecute
    men whose religion is unpopular.

    I cannot believe in any of the creeds of the different
    denominations, because they all have some things in them I cannot
    subscribe to, though all of them have some truth. I want to come
    up into the presence of God, and learn all things; but the creeds
    set up stakes, and say, "Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further;"
    which I cannot subscribe to.

    I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the
    original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or
    designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors. As it
    read, Gen. VI:6, "It repented the Lord that he had made man on the
    earth;" also, Num. XXIII:19, "God is not a man, that he should lie,
    neither the Son of man, that he should repent;" which I do not
    believe. But it ought to read, "It repented _Noah_ that God made
    man." This I believe, and then the other quotation stands fair. If
    any man will prove to me, by one passage of Holy Writ, one item I
    believe to be false, I will renounce and disclaim it as far as I
    promulged it.

    The first principles of the Gospel, as I believe, are, faith,
    repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, with the promise of
    the Holy Ghost.

    {58} Look at Heb. VI:1 for contradictions--"Therefore leaving
    the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto
    perfection." If a man leaves the principles of the doctrine
    of Christ, how can he be saved in the principles? This is a
    contradiction. I don't believe it. I will render it as it should
    be--"Therefore _not_ leaving the principles of the doctrine
    of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the
    foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
    of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of
    resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."

    It is one thing to see the kingdom of God, and another thing to
    enter into it. We must have a change of heart to see the kingdom of
    God, and subscribe the articles of adoption to enter therein.

    No man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations.
    The Holy Ghost is a revelator.

    I prophesy, in the name of the Lord God of Israel, anguish and
    wrath and tribulation and the withdrawing of the Spirit of God from
    the earth await this generation, until they are visited with utter
    desolation. This generation is as corrupt as the generation of the
    Jews that crucified Christ; and if He were here to-day, and should
    preach the same doctrine He did then, they would put Him to death.
    I defy all the world to destroy the work of God; and I prophesy
    they never will have power to kill me till my work is accomplished,
    and I am ready to die.

    I will now speak a little on the economy of this city. I think
    there are too many merchants among you. I would like to see more
    wool and raw materials instead of manufactured goods, and the money
    be brought here to pay the poor for manufacturing goods. Set our
    women to work, and stop their spinning street yarns and talking
    about spiritual wives.

    Instead of going abroad to buy goods, lay your money out in
    the country, and buy grain, cattle, flax, wool, and work it up
    yourselves.

    I proclaim, in the name of the Lord God Almighty, that I will
    fellowship nothing in the Church but virtue, integrity, and
    uprightness.

    We cannot build up a city on merchandise. I would not run after the
    merchants. I would sow a little flax, if I had but a garden spot,
    and make clothing of it.

    The temporal economy of this people should be to establish and
    encourage manufactures, and not to take usury for their money. I do
    not want to bind the poor here to starve. Go out into the country
    and into the neighbouring cities, and get food, and gird up your
    loins, and be sober. When you get food, return, if you have a mind
    to.

    Some say it is better to give to the poor than build the Temple.
    The building of the Temple has sustained the poor who were driven
    from Missouri, and kept them from starving; and it has been the
    best means for this object which could be devised.

    {59} Oh, all ye rich men of the Latter-day Saints from abroad, I
    would invite you to bring up some of your money--your gold, your
    silver, and your precious things, and give to the Temple. We want
    iron, steel, spades, and quarrying and mechanical tools.

    It would be a good plan to get up a forge to manufacture iron, and
    bring in raw materials of every variety, and erect manufacturing
    establishments of all kinds, and surround the rapids with mills and
    machinery.

    I never stole the value of a pin's head, or a picayune in my life;
    and when you are hungry don't steal. Come to me, and I will feed
    you.

    The secret of masonry is to keep a secret. It is good economy to
    entertain strangers--to entertain sectarians. Come up to Nauvoo, ye
    sectarian priests of the everlasting Gospel, as they call it, and
    you shall have my pulpit all day.

    Woe to ye rich men, who refuse to give to the poor, and then come
    and ask me for bread. Away with all your meanness, and be liberal.
    We need purging, purifying and cleansing. You that have little
    faith in your Elders when you are sick, get some little simple
    remedy in the first stages. If you send for a doctor at all, send
    in the first stages.

    All ye doctors who are fools, not well read, and do not understand
    the human constitution, stop your practice. And all ye lawyers who
    have no business, only as you hatch it up, would to God you would
    go to work or run away!"

_Monday, 16.--_At home nearly all day, attending to family concerns.

Went to municipal court, and adjourned hearing of the case [1] to the
17th.

_Tuesday, 17.--_Went to municipal court. The prosecutor not appearing,
court ordered that the prisoner be discharged.

_Wednesday, 18.--_Pleasant and comfortable day.

Fifteen deaths have occurred during the past week in the city.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Visit to Macedonia.]

_Thursday, 19.--_Warm and pleasant day. The water has risen about two
feet in the Mississippi, and is still rising.

About noon, started for Macedonia, in company with Brother William
Clayton. Arrived there about {60} sundown, and I stayed at Brother
Benjamin F. Johnson's for the night.

_Friday, 20.--_In the evening I gave instructions to Benjamin F.
Johnson and others in relation to the blessings of the everlasting
covenant and the sealings of the Priesthood.

Elder John P. Greene returned from a Mission to the State of New York,
with about 100 emigrants, some of them from Pennsylvania, who joined
his company on the way.

Warm, smoky day, with strong wind, very dark evening.

_Saturday, 21.--_We left Macedonia, and arrived home about two p.m.
Pleasant cool day.

_Sunday, 22.--_Meeting at the stand. Elder Rigdon preached half-an hour
on "Poor Rich Folks."

I remained at home all day, and held a prayer-meeting at my house at
two, p.m.; twenty-four persons present.

[Sidenote: Labors of Apostles in the East.]

Elders Young, Kimball, and George A. Smith returned from their mission
to the Eastern States, having, in connection with Elders Orson
Pratt and Wilford Woodruff, visited the branches in Kentucky, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, New Hampshire, and Maine; held conferences, set in order the
churches collected tithings for the Temple and subscriptions for
the Nauvoo House, baptized many, and stirred up a general system of
gathering among the Saints in the Eastern countries. They have been
absent nearly four months, and have accomplished a good work. I was
very glad to see them, and blessed them in the name of the Lord. Elders
Daniel Spencer and Bradford Elliot also returned from their missions,
and quite a respectable number of Saints came in their company.

Pleasant, cool day.

_Monday, 23.--_Those of the Twelve who returned from the East yesterday
visited me through the day, and paid over the means they had received
for the Temple and the {61} Nauvoo House. I immediately gave directions
to send to St. Louis for groceries and different articles necessary for
the Temple and the workmen thereon.

[Sidenote: Hyrum Smith Appointed on Temple Committee.]

This morning President Hyrum Smith entered upon the duties of his
office, having previously been appointed by the voice of the Spirit
to supply the place of the late Elias Higbee, deceased, as one of
the Temple Committee. On his arrival at the Temple he was greeted by
a hearty welcome from those engaged on the works, and the universal
feeling is that great good will result from this appointment.

The day cloudy, with strong east wind.

_Tuesday, 24.--_William W. Phelps and Colonel Dunham started for
Springfield to see the Governor, and endeavor to obtain from him the
quota of State arms which belong to the Legion.

Morning warm and pleasant; afternoon wind west by north. At four, a
little rain, accompanied by snow, for the first time this fall.

_Wednesday, 25.--_Ice one-third of an inch thick on small bodies of
water. Cloudy and cold day.

In the evening settled the taxes for the Temple and Nauvoo House.

    _Letter: Joseph L. Heywood to Joseph Smith._

    Quincy, October 23, 1843.

    _Gen. Joseph Smith._

    DEAR SIR,--In a conversation with Colonel Frierson, of this place,
    a short time since, he expressed, in very warm terms, feelings of
    sympathy for the wrongs yourself and brethren suffered in Missouri,
    as well as his sense of the vindictive feelings the authorities of
    that State still manifest towards you personally.

    Mr. F. has not yet had the pleasure of a personal acquaintance
    with yourself, although he says he had the pleasure of meeting
    your lady at her sister's residence on Rock River. Mr. F. has been
    written by the Hon. B. Rhett, of S. Carolina, upon the subject of
    the _Persecution_: and {63} Mr. F. thinks, of all men, he would
    be the best qualified to present a petition in our behalf; and
    says, should such an arrangement meet your approbation, he will
    use his influence in favor of a petition; and says he knows of
    some honorable men in Missouri who, he has no doubt, are anxious
    to wipe off the stain that rests upon them, by [making] some just
    reparation.

    I submit, by permission of Mr. F., a copy of a letter he has
    written to a distinguished citizen of South Carolina, together with
    a circular put out confidentially by the friends of Mr. Calhoun,
    of S. C., whom with my present feelings I should cheerfully
    support for our next President, and who, I have no doubt would be
    preferred, by the brethren to Mr. Van Buren.

    If the plan suggested of memorializing Congress should meet your
    approbation, please inform me. Colonel Frierson promises his
    aid in such an event, and says he would go to Nauvoo and assist
    in arranging papers relative to such a step. Please accept my
    assurances of love and esteem for yourself and family, and a prayer
    that wisdom from on high may direct you in your deliberations.

    I remain your brother in Christ,

    JOS. L. HEYWOOD.

[Sidenote: Letters to Candidates for Presidency of the U.S. Decided
upon]

We agreed to write a letter to the five candidates for the Presidency
of the United States, to inquire what their feelings were towards us
as a people, and what their course of action would be in relation to
the cruelty and oppression that we have suffered from the State of
Missouri, if they were elected.

The Twelve Apostles published the following in the_ Times and
Seasons_:--

    _An Epistle of the Twelve, to the Elders and Churches Abroad._

    On our late mission to the Eastern States, we discovered that
    the publications at Nauvoo were very little patronised by the
    Saints and branches in the various sections of the country where
    we passed, while the common newspapers of the day received a
    liberal support by those who pretend to "hunger and thirst after
    righteousness." We feel justified, therefore, in reprobating such a
    course as detrimental to the general good of the whole Church, that
    shows a lack of charity in the Elders.

    "Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"

    Nauvoo at present is the seat of the First Presidency, the place
    of the {64} gathering for all Saints, and the great center of the
    world for pure religion, revelation, truth, virtue, knowledge, and
    everything else preparatory to the coming of the Son of Man. The
    best news, the best people, and the best plan of salvation must be
    there. Wherefore,

    Resolved unanimously that the traveling Elders are hereby
    instructed to use due diligence in obtaining subscribers for the
    _Times and Seasons_ and _Nauvoo Neighbor,_ and forward the pay
    by safe hands to the publishers at Nauvoo, that the Saints and
    the world may receive "line upon line and precept upon precept,
    here a little and there a little," together with such extracts of
    translations and revelations as the Presidency of the Church may
    direct, for the edification of the whole body of the Church in
    righteousness.

    Done in council at Nauvoo, Nov. 2nd, 1843.

    BRIGHAM YOUNG,

    President of the Twelve.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, Clerk.

_Friday, 3rd.--_I continued in council all day.

Died at sea, Elder Knowlton F. Hanks. The following extract is from a
letter of Addison Pratt, one of the Pacific Islands missionaries:--

 [Under this date there is inserted in the Prophet's History a long
 letter from Elder Addison Pratt of the Pacific Island mission,
 describing in great detail the last illness, death and burial at sea
 of Elder Knowlton F. Hanks. Elder Hanks died of consumption; and of
 the death the Prophet remarks: "Elder Hanks is the first Elder who has
 died at sea while on a foreign mission. He was a faithful Elder, cut
 off by consumption in the flower of his days."]

_Saturday, 4.--_Elders Richards and Taylor were with me at the Mansion,
assisting writing letters.

Wrote to John C. Calhoun as follows:--

    _President Smith's Letter to John C. Calhoun, and other
    Presidential Candidates._

    _Hon. John C. Calhoun._

    DEAR SIR,--As we understand you are a candidate for the Presidency
    at the next election; and as the Latter-day Saints (sometimes
    called "Mormons," who now constitute a numerous class in the school
    politic of this vast republic,) have been robbed of an immense
    amount of property, and endured nameless sufferings by the State of
    Missouri, and from her borders have been driven by force of arms,
    contrary to our national covenants; and as in vain we have sought
    redress by all constitutional, legal, and honorable means, in her
    courts, her executive {65} councils, and her legislative halls; and
    as we have petitioned Congress to take cognizance of our sufferings
    without effect, we have judged it wisdom to address you this
    communication, and solicit an immediate, specific, and candid reply
    to _"What will be your rule of action relative to us as a people,"_
    should fortune favor your ascension to the chief magistracy?

    Most respectfully, sir, your friend,

    and the friend of peace, good order,

    and constitutional rights,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    In behalf of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Similar letters were written to Gen. Lewis Cass, Hon. Richard M.
Johnson, Hon. Henry Clay, and President Martin Van Buren. To Mr. Van
Buren's letter I added the following:--

    _Post Script to Van Buren._

    Also whether your views or feelings have changed since the subject
    matter of this communication was presented you in your then
    official capacity at Washington, in the year 1841, and by you
    treated with a coldness, indifference, and neglect, bordering on
    contempt.

Elder Wilford Woodruff arrived at Nauvoo with paper for the use of the
printing office.

_Sunday, 5.--_Rode out with mother and others for her health.

[Sidenote: The Prophet poisoned.]

At dinner I was taken suddenly sick; went to the door and vomited all
my dinner, dislocated my jaw, and raised fresh blood, and had many
symptoms of being poisoned.

In the evening a prayer-meeting in the hall over the store.

Mr. Cole having kept a school in the hall for some time, the noise
proved a nuisance for the clerks in the history office, and I gave Dr.
W. Richards orders to tell Mr. Cole he must find some other room in
which to teach school, as the room is needed for councils.

Meeting at the stand. Elder Rigdon preached.

[Sidenote: Work in the British Mission.]

Received a letter from Reuben Hedlock, dated Liverpool, October 16. He
informs me there is a great call for {66} preaching, and many Elders
are wanted throughout the British Isles. Much opposition. The Saints
are anxious to have the _Star_ continue its publication, as 1,600
copies are circulated.

Also received a letter from Hyrum Clark, giving a partial account of
the business affairs of the emigration and publishing offices.

_Monday, 6.--_Domestic affairs kept me busy in the morning, and in the
afternoon listened to William W. Phelps giving a relation of his visit
to the governor, which amused me.

It has been very cool for some days past.

Elder Erastus Snow arrived with a company from Massachusetts.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Anxiety concerning the History of the Church.]

_Tuesday, 7.--_Mr. Cole moved the tables back into the hall, when
Richards and Phelps called to report that the noise in the school
disturbed them in the progress of writing the History. I gave orders
that Cole must look out for another place, as the history must continue
and not be disturbed, as there are but few subjects that I have felt a
greater anxiety about than my history, which has been a very difficult
task, on account of the death of my best clerks and the apostasy of
others, and the stealing of records by John Whitmer, Cyrus Smalling and
others.

[Sidenote: Preliminary Steps to Publish in Nauvoo Edition of Doctrine
and Covenants.]

The quorum of the Twelve--viz., President Brigham Young, Parley P.
Pratt, Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith,
and Willard Richards, assembled in the mayor's office, and voted to
raise $500 to get paper, &c., to print the _Doctrine and Covenants._
Also voted that Parley P. Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, and John Taylor be a
committee to borrow or get the money, and that President Young go along
with them.

_Wednesday, 8.--_From nine to eleven, a.m., had an interview with
Richards and Phelps, read and heard read part of my history, then
attended to settling some accounts {67} with several individuals. In
the afternoon, I examined a sample of fringe designed for the pulpits
of the Temple; and from two to three, conversed with Phelps, Lewis,
John Butler and others.

The _Neighbor_ has the following:--

    _Misrepresentations Corrected._

    We know that statements made by the Carthage mob in their
    resolutions, as published in the late _Warsaw Message,_ were false.
    We also felt convinced that the parties themselves were apprized
    of that fact, and that it was a thing generally understood by
    the public; and therefore we did not trouble ourselves about it.
    But having the following testimonies and affidavits sent us for
    publication, we insert them for the information of those who may
    not have had opportunities of informing themselves relative to this
    subject.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS

    LEE COUNTY. ss.

    We the undersigned citizens of the town of Dixon, county of Lee,
    State of Illinois, being duly sworn according to law, depose and
    say that we have seen the article entitled "Statement of facts
    connected with the arrest of Joseph Smith and his discharge
    therefrom," published in the _Warsaw Message_ of the date of 15th
    of July, A.D. 1843; and have also seen an editorial article in
    the same number of said paper, in which it is stated that said
    statement of facts was furnished by E. Southwick, one of Mr.
    Smith's attorneys in said case; and that we know the fact stated in
    that statement--to wit, that Reynolds, for a considerable length
    of time immediately after his arrival at Dixon, did peremptorily
    refuse to allow Smith a private interview with his counsel; and
    that said Reynolds did expressly state that no conversation could
    be had with Smith by his attorneys, unless he, Reynolds, was
    present at such conversation.

    The length of time which such refusal to allow said private
    conversation continued, was, in the belief of these deponents,
    at least one hour; and that such private conversation was not
    permitted by Reynolds, until after being informed by at least two
    of these deponents (Messrs. Dixon and Sanger) that such private
    interview must be allowed Mr. Smith, as that was a right he had
    guaranteed to him by law.

    FREDERICK R. DUTCHER,

    Justice of the Peace for Lee County, Ill.

    We, the undersigned, state under oath that we traveled in company
    with Joseph H. Reynolds, the agent of the State of Missouri, from
    Dixon to Nauvoo, at the time he had Joseph Smith in custody with
    the intention of taking him to Missouri, between the 26th of June
    last and the 1st instant; and that the Mormons, friends of Mr.
    Smith, who met us on said journey, before we arrived at Nauvoo,
    conducted themselves, so far as we could perceive and were able
    to judge, with the strictest propriety; and to our knowledge made
    use of no means of intimidation towards either H. T. Wilson or
    said Reynolds; but, on the contrary, several of them, and said
    Smith among that number, pledged themselves that said Wilson and
    Reynolds should be personally safe; and that said Mormons, none of
    them as we could perceive, were armed, so far as was discernible;
    and further, that the statement made in the _Old School Democrat_
    of the 12th instant, over the signature of T. H. Reynolds, that
    he and said Wilson were disarmed soon after they were arrested on
    the trespass suit commenced against them by said Smith, and that
    their arms were not returned to them until after the said Smith's
    discharge at Nauvoo, was incorrect. And in relation to this, these
    deponents say that said Wilson and Reynolds were arrested on said
    action of trespass at Dixon, on Saturday morning, the 24th of June
    last. That they were not disarmed by the sheriff of Lee county, who
    had them in custody, nor by any other person, until the following
    day, at Paw-paw Grove, thirty-two miles distant from Dixon; and
    that the arms of said Wilson and Reynolds were restored to them by
    the said sheriff of Lee county, who had them in custody for default
    of bail, at their (Wilson and Reynolds') own request, while on the
    journey from Dixon to Nauvoo, before the company had arrived within
    at least eighty miles of Nauvoo.

    _To the Editor of the Warsaw Message_:

    GENTLEMEN:--It appears from an article in your paper of the 15th of
    July under the editorial head, that there is a question of veracity
    therein {69} raised, between Mr. H. T Wilson and myself, relative
    to the proceedings had after the late arrest by him of Joseph
    Smith. Now, in order that the public may no longer be deceived in
    the premises, be pleased to publish, together with this note, the
    above affidavits, that the charge of falsehood may attach where it
    properly belongs.

    Very respectfully yours,

    E. SOUTHWICK.

    Dixon July 29, 1843.

I wrote to the _Times and Seasons_:--

    _Communication of President Joseph Smith to the Saints._

    _Messrs. Taylor and Woodruff_:

    It has been so long since I addressed the Saints through the medium
    of the _Times and Seasons,_ that I feel confident that a few words
    from my pen, by way of advice, will be well received, as well as a
    "waymark" to guide the "faithful" in future. I was sorry to learn,
    by your remarks upon the resolutions of the "Twelve" concerning
    your papers, which appeared not long since, that many of the Saints
    abroad were more apt to patronize the common newspapers of the
    day than yours, for the important reason that the Church of Jesus
    Christ of Latter-day Saints has the words of eternal life, and
    your paper, as it has hitherto done, must continue to publish such
    portions of them for the benefit of the Saints and the salvation of
    mankind as wisdom shall from time to time direct.

    Freedom is a sweet blessing. Men have a right to take and read what
    papers they please; "but do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs
    of thistles?" It certainly is no more than just to suppose that
    _charity begins at home;_ and if so, what must such as profess to
    be Saints think, when they patronize the splendor of Babylon and
    leave the virtue of Zion to linger for want of bread?

    Beside which, if virtue is justified rather than vanity, the
    best of everything calculated to happify man and dignify society
    will--yea, must be in Nauvoo. And as the new commandment given
    anciently was _to love one another,_ even so the works of the
    Saints at home and abroad will bear its own testimony _whether they
    love the brethren_.

    In all the world the _Times and Seasons_ is the only paper that
    virtually sustains, according to the forms of Scripture and
    prophecy, "Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists," and revelations. And
    what shall be said of him that, like the "Levite," passes on the
    other side of the way, when we behold men who "have borne the heat
    and the burden of the day" struggling against the popular opinions
    of a vain world, the burlesque of a giddy throng, the vulgarity of
    a self-wise multitude, and the falsehoods of what may justly be
    termed the "civilized meanness of the {70} age," and not lending
    a helping hand? The 25th chapter of Matthew contains the simple
    answer.

    Now, let me say once for all, like the Psalmist of old, "How good
    and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity."
    "As the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon Aaron's
    beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments, as the dew
    of Hermon that descended upon the mountains of Zion," is such
    unity; for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for
    evermore!" Unity is power; and when the brethren as one man sustain
    the _Times and Seasons,_ they sustain me, by giving a spread to
    the revelations, faith, works, history and progress of the Church.
    The brethren who conduct the paper have been appointed to that
    important station, because they are worthy and well qualified; and
    what a blessed sign of a faithful friend to God and man is it to
    see the charity of a brother support his brethren, as an evidence
    that he means to pass from death into life?

    Many of the articles which appear in the _Times and Seasons_ are
    extracts of revelations, translations, or are the united voice of
    conferences, which, like "apples of gold in pictures of silver,"
    are treasures more than meat for the called, chosen and faithful
    among the Saints, and should be more than _drink_ to those that
    hunger and thirst after righteousness. As Nauvoo is rising in glory
    and greatness, so shall I expect to see the _Times and Seasons_
    increase in circulation by the vigilance of the Elders and Saints,
    so as to be a herald of truth and a standard of pure and undefiled
    religion. Finally, men and brethren, when you support my friends,
    you support me. In the bonds of the new and everlasting covenant,

    I am your humble servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    _Letter: James Arlington Bennett to President Joseph Smith._

    ARLINGTON HOUSE, Oct. 43, 1843.

    DEAR GENERAL:--I am happy to know that you have taken possession
    of your new establishment, and presume you will be eminently
    successful and happy in it, together with your good lady and family.

    You are no doubt already aware that I have had a most interesting
    visit from your most excellent and worthy friend, President B.
    Young with whom I have had a glorious frolic in the clear blue
    ocean; for {72} most assuredly a frolic it was, without a moment's
    reflection or consideration.

    Nothing of this kind would in the least attach me to your person or
    cause. I am capable of being a most _undeviating friend_, without
    being governed by the smallest religious influence.

    As you have proved yourself to be a philosophical divine, you will
    excuse me when I say that we must leave their influence to the
    mass. The boldness of your plans and measures, together with their
    unparalleled success so far, are calculated to throw a charm over
    your whole being, and to point you out as the most extraordinary
    man of the present age.

    But my mind is of so mathematical and philosophical a cast, that
    the divinity of Moses makes no impression on me, and you will not
    be offended when I say that I rate you higher as a legislator than
    I do Moses, because we have you present with us for examination,
    whereas Moses derives his chief authority from prescription and the
    lapse of time.

    I cannot, however, say but you are both right, it being out of the
    power of man to prove you wrong. It is no mathematical problem, and
    can therefore get no mathematical solution. I say, therefore, Go
    a-head: you have my good wishes. You know Mahomet had his "_right
    hand man_."

    The celebrated Thomas Brown, at New York, is now engaged in cutting
    your head on a beautiful cornelian stone, as your _private seal,_
    which will be set in gold to your order, and sent to you. It will
    be a gem, and just what you want. His sister is a member of your
    Church. The expense of this seal, set in gold, will be about $40;
    and Mr. Brown assures me that if he were not so poor a man, he
    would present it to you free.

    You can, however, accept it or not, as he can apply to it another
    use. I am myself short for cash; for although I had sometime since
    $2,000 paid me by the Harpers, publishers, as the first instalment
    on the purchase of my copyright, yet I had got so much behind
    during the hard times, that it all went to clear up old scores. I
    expect $38,000 more however, in semi-annual payments, from those
    gentlemen, within the limits of ten years; a large portion of
    which I intend to use in the State of Illinois, in the purchase
    and conduct of a large tract of land; and therefore should I be
    compelled to announce in this quarter that I have no connection
    with the Nauvoo Legion, you will of course remain silent, as I
    shall do it in such a way as will make all things right.

    I may yet run for a high office in your state, when you would
    be sure of my best services in your behalf; therefore, a known
    connection with you would be against our mutual interest. It can be
    shown that a commission in the Legion was a _Herald_ hoax, coined
    for the fun of it {73} by me, as it is not believed even now by
    the public. In short, I expect to be yet, through your influence,
    governor of the State of Illinois.

    My respects to Brothers Young, Richards, Mrs. Emma, and all friends.

    Yours most respectfully,

    JAMES ARLINGTON BENNETT.

    P.S.--As the office of inspector-general confers no command on me,
    being a mere honorary title,--if, therefore, there is any gentleman
    in Nauvoo who would like to fill it in a practical way, I shall
    with great pleasure and good-will resign it to him, by receiving
    advice from you to that effect. It is an office that should be
    filled by some scientific officer.

    NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, Nov. 13, 1843.

    DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 24th ult. has been regularly
    received, its contents duly appreciated, and its whole tenor
    candidly considered; and, according to my manner of judging all
    things in righteousness, I proceed to answer you, and shall leave
    you to meditate whether "mathematical problems," founded upon the
    truth of revelation, or religion as promulgated by me, or by Moses,
    can be solved by rules and principles existing in the systems of
    common knowledge.

    How far you are capable of being "a most undeviating friend,
    without being governed by the smallest religious influence," will
    best be decided by your survivors, as all past experience most
    assuredly proves. Without controversy, that friendship which
    intelligent beings would accept as sincere must arise from love,
    and that love grow out of virtue, which is as much a part of
    religion as light is a part of Jehovah. Hence the saying of Jesus,
    "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
    for his friends."

    You observed, "as I have proven myself to be a philosophical
    divine" I must excuse you when you say that we must leave these
    _influences_ to the mass. The meaning of "philosophical divine" may
    be taken in various ways. If, as the learned world apply the term,
    you infer that I have achieved a victory, and been strengthened by
    a scientific religion, as practiced by the popular sects of the
    age, through the aid of colleges, seminaries, Bible societies,
    missionary boards, financial organizations, and gospel money
    schemes, then you are wrong. Such a combination of men and means
    shows a form of godliness without the power; for is it not written,
    "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise." "Beware lest any man spoil
    you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the rudiments of the
    world, and not after the doctrines of Christ." But if the inference
    is that by more love, more light, more virtue, and more truth
    {74} from the Lord, I have succeeded as a man of God, then you
    reason truly, though the weight of the sentiment is lost, when the
    _"influence is left to the mass."_ "Do men gather grapes of thorns,
    or figs of thistles?"

    Of course you follow out the figure, and say, the boldness of my
    plans and measures, together with their unparalleled success, so
    far, are calculated to throw a charm over my whole being, and
    to point me out as the most extraordinary man of the present
    age! The _boldness of my plans and measures_ can readily be
    tested by the touchstone of all schemes, systems, projects, and
    adventures--_truth;_ for truth is a matter of fact; and the fact
    is, that by the power of God I translated the Book of Mormon from
    hieroglyphics, the knowledge of which was lost to the world, in
    which wonderful event I stood alone, an unlearned youth, to combat
    the worldly wisdom and multiplied ignorance of eighteen centuries,
    with a new revelation, which (if they would receive the everlasting
    Gospel,) would open the eyes of more than eight hundred millions of
    people, and make "plain the old paths," wherein if a man walk in
    all the ordinances of God blameless, he shall inherit eternal life;
    and Jesus Christ, who was, and is, and is to come, has borne me
    safely over every snare and plan laid in secret or openly, through
    priestly hypocrisy, sectarian prejudice, popular philosophy,
    executive power, or law-defying mobocracy, to destroy me.

    If, then, the hand of God in all these things that I have
    accomplished towards the salvation of a priest-ridden generation,
    in the short space of twelve years, through the boldness of the
    plan of preaching the Gospel, and the boldness of the means of
    declaring repentance and baptism for the remission of sins, and a
    reception of the Holy Ghost by laying on of the hands, agreeably to
    the authority of the Priesthood, and the still more bold measures
    of receiving direct revelation from God, through the Comforter,
    as promised, and by which means all holy men from ancient times
    till now have spoken and revealed the will of God to men, with
    the consequent "success" of the gathering of the Saints, throws
    any "charm" around my being, and "points me out as the most
    extraordinary man of the age," it demonstrates the fact that truth
    is mighty and must prevail, and that one man empowered from Jehovah
    has more influence with the children of the kingdom than eight
    hundred millions led by the precepts of men. God exalts the humble,
    and debases the haughty.

    But let me assure you in the name of Jesus, "who spake as never
    man spake," that the "boldness of the plans and measures," as you
    term them, but which should be denominated the righteousness of
    the cause, the truth of the system, and power of God, which "so
    far" has borne me and the Church, (in which I glory in having the
    privilege of being a member,) successfully through the storm of
    reproach, folly, ignorance, {75} malice, persecution, falsehood,
    sacerdotal wrath, newspaper satire, pamphlet libels, and the
    combined influence of the powers of earth and hell,--I say these
    powers of righteousness and truth are not the decrees or rules
    of an ambitious and aspiring Nimrod, Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar,
    Alexander, Mahomet, Bonaparte, or other great sounding heroes that
    dazzled forth with a trail of pomp and circumstances for a little
    season, like a comet, and then disappeared, leaving a wide waste
    where such an existence once was, with only a name; nor where the
    glorious results of what you term "boldness of plans and measures,"
    with the attendant "success," matured by the self-aggrandizing
    wisdom of the priests of Baal, the scribes and Pharisees of the
    Jews, popes and bishops of Christendom, or pagans of Juggernaut:
    nor were they extended by the divisions and subdivisions of a
    Luther or Calvin, a Wesley, or even a Campbell, supported by a
    galaxy of clergymen and churchmen, of whatever name or nature,
    bound apart by cast-iron creeds, and fastened to set stakes by
    chain-cable opinions, without revelation. Nor are they the lions of
    the land, or the leviathans of the sea, moving among the elements,
    as distant chimeras to fatten the fancy of the infidel; but they
    are as the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and will
    become a great mountain, and fill the whole earth. [1] * * * * *

    It seems that your mind is of such "a mathematical and
    philosophical cast," that the divinity of Moses makes no impression
    upon you, and that I will not be offended when you say that you
    rate me higher as a legislator than you do Moses, because you have
    me present with you for examination; that "Moses derives his chief
    authority from prescription and the lapse of time." You cannot,
    however, say but we are both right, it being out of the power of
    man to prove us wrong. "It is no mathematical problem, and can
    therefore get no mathematical solution."

    {76} Now, sir, to cut the matter short, and not dally with your
    learned ideas, for fashion's sake you have here given your opinion,
    without reserve, that revelation, the knowledge of God, prophetic
    vision, the truth of eternity, cannot be solved as a mathematical
    problem. The first question then is, What is a mathematical
    problem? and the natural answer is, A statement, proposition or
    question that can be solved, ascertained, unfolded or demonstrated
    by knowledge, facts or figures; for "mathematical" is an adjective
    derived from _mathesis_ (Gr.), meaning, in English, learning or
    knowledge. "Problem" is derived from _probleme_ (French), or
    _problema_ (Italian, or Spanish), and in each language means a
    question or proposition, whether true or false. "Solve" is derived
    from the Latin verb "_solvo,_" to explain or answer.

    One thing more in order to prove the work as we proceed. It is
    necessary to have witnesses, two or three of whose testimonies,
    according to the laws or rules of God and man, are sufficient to
    establish any one point.

    Now for the question. How much are one and one? Two. How much is
    one from two? One. Very well; one question or problem is solved by
    figures. Now, let me ask one for facts; Was there ever such a place
    on the earth as Egypt? Geography says yes; ancient history says
    yes; and the Bible says yes: so three witnesses have solved that
    question. Again: Lived there ever such a man as Moses in Egypt?
    The same witnesses reply, _Certainly._ And was he a Prophet? The
    same witnesses, or a part, have left on record that Moses predicted
    in Leviticus that if Israel broke the covenant they had made, the
    Lord would scatter them among the nations, till the land enjoyed
    her Sabbaths: and, subsequently, these witnesses have testified of
    their captivity in Babylon and other places, in fulfillment. But
    to make assurance doubly sure, Moses prays that the ground might
    open and swallow up Korah and his company for transgression, and
    it was so: and he endorses the prophecy of Balaam, which said, Out
    of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy
    him that remaineth of the city: and Jesus Christ, as Him that "had
    dominion," about fifteen hundred years after, in accordance with
    this and the prediction of Moses, David, Isaiah, and many others,
    came, saying, Moses wrote of me, declaring the dispersion of the
    Jews, and the utter destruction of the city; and the Apostles were
    his witnesses, unimpeached, especially Jude, who not only endorses
    the facts of Moses "divinity," but also the events of Balaam and
    Korah, with many others, _as true_.

    Besides these tangible facts, so easily proven and demonstrated
    by simple rules and testimony unimpeached, the art (now lost,) of
    embalming human bodies, and preserving them in the catacombs of
    Egypt, whereby men, women and children, _as mummies,_ after a lapse
    of near {77} three thousand five hundred years, come forth among
    the living; and although _dead,_ the papyrus which has lived in
    their bosoms, unharmed, speaks for them in language like the sound
    of an earthquake. _Ecce veritas! Ecce cadaveros!_ Behold the truth!
    Behold the mummies!

    Oh, my dear sir, the sunken Tyre and Sidon, the melancholy dust
    where the city of Jerusalem once was, and the mourning of the Jews
    among the nations, together with such a cloud of witnesses, if you
    had been as well acquainted with your God and Bible as with your
    purse and pence table, the divinity of Moses would have dispelled
    the fog of five thousand years and filled you with light; for
    facts, like diamonds, not only cut glass, but they are the most
    precious jewels on earth. The spirit of prophecy is the testimony
    of Jesus.

    The world at large is ever ready to credit the writings of Homer,
    Hesiod, Plutarch, Socrates, Pythagoras, Virgil, Josephus, Mahomet,
    and an hundred others; but where, tell me, where, have they left a
    line--a simple method of solving the truth of the plan of eternal
    life? Says the Savior, "If any man will do his [the Father's] will,
    he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I
    speak of myself." Here, then, is a method of solving the divinity
    of men by the divinity within yourself, that as far exceeds the
    calculations of numbers as the sun exceeds a candle. Would to God
    that all men understood it and were willing to be governed by it,
    that when one had filled the measure of his days, he could exclaim
    like Jesus, _Veni mori, et reviviscere_!'

    Your good wishes to go ahead, coupled with Mahomet and a right hand
    man, are rather more vain than virtuous. Why, sir, Caesar had his
    right hand Brutus, who was his left hand assassin,--not, however,
    applying the allusion to you.

    As to the private seal you mention, if sent to me, I shall receive
    it with the gratitude of a servant of God, and pray that the donor
    may receive a reward in the resurrection of the just.

    The summit of your future fame seems to be hid in the political
    policy of a "mathematical problem" for the chief magistracy of this
    state, which I suppose might be solved by "double position," where
    the _errors_ of the _supposition_ are used to produce a true answer.

    But, sir, when I leave the dignity and honor I received from
    heaven, to boost a man into power, through the aid of my
    friends, where the evil and designing, after the object has been
    accomplished, can lock up the clemency intended as a reciprocation
    for such favors, and where the wicked and unprincipled, as a
    matter of course, would seize the opportunity to flintify the
    hearts of the nation against me for dabbling at a sly game in
    politics,--verily I say, when I leave the dignity and honor of
    heaven, to gratify the ambition and vanity of man or men, {78} may
    my power cease, like the strength of Samson, when he was shorn
    of his locks, while asleep in the lap of Delilah. Truly said the
    Savior, "Cast not your pearls before swine, lest they trample them
    under their feet, and turn again and rend you."

    Shall I, who have witnessed the visions of eternity, and beheld
    the glorious mansions of bliss, and the regions and the misery of
    the damned,--shall I turn to be a Judas? Shall I, who have heard
    the voice of God, and communed with angels, and spake as moved
    by the Holy Ghost for the renewal of the everlasting covenant,
    and for the gathering of Israel in the last days,--shall I worm
    myself into a political hypocrite? Shall I, who hold the keys of
    the last kingdom, in which is the dispensation of the fullness of
    all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy Prophets since
    the world began, under the sealing power of the Melchizedec
    Priesthood,--shall I stoop from the sublime authority of Almighty
    God, to be handled as a monkey's cat-paw, and pettify myself into
    a clown to act the farce of political demagoguery? No--verily no!
    The whole earth shall bear me witness that I, like the towering
    rock in the midst of the ocean, which has withstood the mighty
    surges of the warring waves for centuries, _am impregnable,_ and am
    a faithful friend to virtue, and a fearless foe to vice,--no odds
    whether the former was sold as a pearl in Asia or hid as a gem in
    America, and the latter dazzles in palaces or glimmers among the
    tombs.

    I combat the errors of ages; I meet the violence of mobs; I cope
    with illegal proceedings from executive authority; I cut the
    guardian knot of powers, and I solve mathematical problems of
    universities, _with truth--diamond truth; and God is my "right hand
    man_." [2]

    And to close, let me say in the name of Jesus Christ to you, and to
    presidents, emperors, kings, queens, governors, rulers, nobles, and
    men in authority everywhere, Do the works of righteousness, execute
    justice and judgment in the earth, that God may bless you and her
    inhabitants; and

  The laurel that grows on the top of the mountain
  Shall green for your fame while the sun sheds a ray;
  And the lily that blows by the side of the fountain
  Will bloom for your virtue till earth melt away.

    With due consideration and respect, I have the honor to be

    Your most obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    P.S. The court-martial will attend to your case in the Nauvoo

_Saturday, 25.--_Colonel Frierson, United States Surveyor from Quincy,
arrived in Nauvoo. In the evening the High Council sat on the case of
Harrison Sagers, charged with seduction, and having stated that I had
taught it was right. Charge not sustained. I was present with several
of the Twelve, and gave an address tending to do away with every evil,
and exhorting them to practice virtue and holiness before the Lord;
told them that the Church had not received any permission from me to
commit fornication, adultery, or any corrupt action; but my every word
and action has been to the contrary. If a man commit adultery, he
cannot receive the celestial kingdom of God. Even if he is saved in any
kingdom, it cannot be the celestial kingdom. I did think that the many
examples that have been made manifest, such as John C. Bennett's and
others, were sufficient to show the fallacy of such a course of conduct.

I condemned such actions _in toto,_ and warned the people present
against committing such evils; for it will surely bring a curse upon
any person who commits such deeds.

After adjournment, held a council, and agreed to meet Mr. Frierson [4]
at the Mansion to morrow morning.

I received a letter signed by George B. Wallace and six other Elders,
requesting permission for Elder John E. Page to remain in Boston the
ensuing winter. Also a letter from John E. Page, giving his assent to
the petition, to which the Twelve Apostles wrote the following reply:--

    _Letter: Brigham Young in Behalf of the Twelve to Elder John E.
    Page, Appointing him to go to Washington._

    _Elder John E. Page_:

    BELOVED BROTHER:--Your letter dated at Boston, in connection with
    {82} some one hundred and fifty of the brethren, is received, and
    we proceed to reply. Your letter is not before us this moment;
    consequently you must excuse a reference to dates and names which
    have escaped our recollection. But the subject is fresh, and the
    letter was read in a council of Presidents Joseph, Hyrum, and the
    Twelve, when the word of the Lord came through Joseph the Seer
    thus:--"Let my servant John E. Page take his departure _speedily_
    from the city of Boston, and go directly to the city of Washington,
    and there labor diligently in proclaiming my Gospel to the
    inhabitants thereof: and if he is humble and faithful, lo! I will
    be with him, and will give him the hearts of the people, that he
    may do them good and build up a church unto my name in that city."

    Now, Brother Page, if you wish to follow counsel and do the will of
    the Lord, as we believe you desire to do, call the church at Boston
    together, _without delay,_ and read this letter to them, calling
    upon them to assist you on your mission, and go thy way speedily
    unto the place which is appointed unto you by the voice of the
    Lord, and build up a church in the city of Washington; for it is
    expedient and absolutely necessary that we have a foothold in that
    popular city. Let your words be soft unto the people, but full of
    the spirit and power of the Holy Ghost. _Do not challenge the sects
    for debate,_ but treat them as brethren and friends; and the God
    of heaven will bless you, and we will bless you in the name of the
    Lord Jesus, and the people will rise up and bless you, and call you
    a sweet messenger of peace. You will pardon us for giving you such
    counsel, for we feel to do it in the name of the Lord.

    When you have built a church at Washington so as to warrant the
    expense. It will be wisdom for you to send or take your wife to
    Washington; so says President Joseph.

    All things go on smoothly here. As to the reports circulated while
    we were in Boston, there is nothing of them. Brother Joseph has
    commenced living in his new house, and enjoys himself well. He
    has raised a sign, entitled "Nauvoo Mansion," and has all the
    best company in the city. Many strangers from abroad call on him,
    feeling perfect liberty so to do, since he has made his house
    public; and it is exerting a blessed influence on the public mind.

    The Temple has been progressing rapidly until the recent frosts.
    The walls are now above the windows of the first story, and some of
    the circular windows are partly laid. The brethren of the Twelve
    have all arrived home, are tolerably well, and their families,
    except Sister Hyde, who has been very sick, and is yet, though at
    last report rather better. No prospect of any of the Twelve leaving
    home this winter {83} that we know of. Elder Snow has arrived with
    his company from Boston, generally in good spirits.

    The devil howls some: may be you will hear him as far as Boston,
    for there cannot a blackleg be guilty of any crime in Nauvoo, but
    somebody will lay it to the servants of God. We shall give the
    substance of this communication to your wife same mail.

    We remain your brother in the new and everlasting covenant, in
    behalf of the quorum,

    BRIGHAM YOUNG, President.

    W. RICHARDS, Clerk.

[Sidenote: Renewal of Petitions to Congress.]

_Sunday, 26.--_I met with Hyrum, the Twelve and others, in council
with Colonel Frierson, at the Mansion, concerning petitioning Congress
for redress of grievances. Read to him the affidavits of Hyrum Smith,
Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt, Lyman Wight, George W. Pitkin and
Sidney Rigdon, taken before the municipal court on _habeas corpus,_ and
conversed with him thereon.

At eleven, a.m., Elder Orson Pratt preached in the Assembly Room.

In the evening, Elder Parley P. Pratt lectured in the Mansion. Rainy,
muddy day.

_Monday, 27.--_Wet day. Being quite unwell, I stayed at home.

_Tuesday, 28.--_At home. Colonel Frierson wrote a Memorial to Congress.
[5]

_Wednesday, 29.--_At home. Clear and cold. Colonel Frierson left for
home, taking with him a copy of the Memorial, to get signers in Quincy.
I here insert a copy of the--

    {84} MEMORIAL.

    _To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the
    United States, in Congress Assembled_.

    The memorial of the undersigned inhabitants of Hancock county, in
    the State of Illinois, respectfully showeth--

    That they belong to the society of Latter-day Saints, commonly
    called "Mormons;" that a portion of our people commenced settling
    in Jackson county, Missouri, in the summer of 1831, where they
    purchased lands and settled upon them with the intention and
    expectation of becoming permanent citizens in common with others.

    From a very early period after the settlement began, a very
    unfriendly feeling was manifested by the neighboring people; and as
    the society increased, this unfriendly spirit also increased, until
    it degenerated into a cruel and unrelenting persecution, and the
    society was at last compelled to leave the county. An account of
    these unprovoked persecutions has been published to the world; yet
    we deem it not improper to embody a few of the most prominent items
    in the memorial, and lay them before your honorable body.

    On the 20th July, 1833, a mob collected at Independence, a
    deputation or committee from which called upon a few members of our
    Church there, and stated to them that the store, printing office,
    and all mechanic shops belonging to our people must be closed
    forthwith, and the society leave the county immediately.

    These conditions were so unexpected and so hard, that a short time
    was asked for to consider on the subject before an answer could be
    given, which was refused; and when some of our men answered that
    they could not consent to comply with such propositions, the work
    of destruction commenced.

    The printing office--a valuable two-story brick building, was
    destroyed by the mob, and with it much valuable property. They
    next went to the store for the same purpose; but one of the owners
    thereof agreeing to close it, they abandoned their design.

    A series of outrages was then commenced by the mob upon individual
    members of our society. Bishop Partridge was dragged from his house
    and family, where he was first partially stripped of his clothes,
    and then tarred and feathered from head to foot. Mr. Charles Allen
    was also tarred at the same time.

    Three days afterwards the mob assembled in great numbers, bearing a
    red flag, and proclaiming that unless the society would leave _en
    masse,_ every man of them should be killed. Being in a defenseless
    situation, to avoid a general massacre, a treaty was entered into
    and ratified, by which it was agreed that one-half of the society
    should leave the county by the 1st of January, and the remainder by
    the 1st of April following.

    {85} In October, while our people were gathering their crops and
    otherwise preparing to fulfill their part of the treaty, the mob
    again collected without any provocation, shot at some of our
    people, whipped others, threw down their houses, and committed many
    other depredations. The members of the society were for some time
    harassed both day and night, their houses assailed and broken open,
    and their women and children insulted and abused.

    The store-house of A. S. Gilbert and Company was broken open,
    ransacked, and some of the goods strewed in the streets. These
    repeated assaults so aroused the indignant feelings of our people,
    that a small party thereof, on one occasion, when wantonly abused,
    resisted the mob. A conflict ensued, in which one of our people and
    some two or three of their assailants were killed.

    This unfortunate event raised the whole county in arms, and we were
    required forthwith to surrender our arms and leave the county.
    Fifty-one guns were given up, which have never been returned or
    paid for to this day.

    Parties of the mob, from thirty to seventy in number, then scoured
    the county in every direction, threatening and abusing women and
    children, until they were forced first to take shelter in the woods
    and prairies at a very inclement season of the year, and finally to
    make their escape to Clay county, where the people permitted them
    to take refuge for a time.

    After the society had left Jackson county, their buildings,
    amounting to about two hundred, were either burned or otherwise
    destroyed, with a great portion of their crops, as well as
    furniture, stock, &c.; for which they have not as yet received any
    remuneration.

    The society remained in Clay county nearly three years, when,
    in compliance with the demands of the citizens there, it was
    determined to remove to that section of country known afterwards as
    Caldwell county.

    In order to secure our people from molestation, the members of
    the society bought out most of the former inhabitants of what is
    now Caldwell county, and also entered much of the wild land then
    belonging to the United States in that section of country, fondly
    hoping that as we were American citizens, obeying the laws and
    assisting to support the government, we would be protected in the
    use of homes which we had honestly purchased from the General
    Government and fully paid for.

    Here we were permitted to enjoy peace for a season; but as our
    society increased in numbers and settlements were made in Daviess
    and Carrol counties, unfounded jealousies sprang up among our
    neighbors, and the spirit of the mob was soon manifested again. The
    people of our Church who had located themselves at De Witt were
    compelled by {86} the mob to leave the place, notwithstanding the
    militia were called out for their protection.

    From De Witt the mob went to Daviess county, and, while on their
    way, took some of our people prisoners, and greatly abused and
    mistreated them. Our people had been driven by force from Jackson
    county; they had been compelled to leave Clay county, and sell
    their lands there, for which they have never been paid: they had
    finally settled in Caldwell county, where they had purchased and
    paid for nearly all the Government land within its limits, in order
    to secure homes where they could live and worship in peace; but
    even here they were soon followed by the mob.

    The society remained in Caldwell from 1836 until the fall of 1838,
    and during that time had acquired by purchase from the Government,
    the settlers, and preemptioners, almost all the lands in the county
    of Caldwell, and a portion of those in Daviess and Carrol counties.

    Those counties, when our people first commenced their settlements,
    were for the most part wild and uncultivated, and they had
    converted them into large and well improved farms, well stocked.
    Lands had risen in value, from 10 to 25 dollars per acre, and those
    counties were rapidly advancing in cultivation and wealth.

    In August, 1838, a riot commenced, growing out of the attempt of
    a member of the society to vote, which resulted in creating great
    excitement and many scenes of lawless outrage. A large mob, under
    the conduct of Cornelius Gilliam, came into the vicinity of Far
    West, drove off our stock, and abused our people. Another party
    came into Caldwell county, took away our horses and cattle, burnt
    our houses, and ordered the inhabitants to leave their homes
    immediately.

    By order of Brigadier-General Doniphan and Colonel Hinkle, a
    company of about sixty men, under the command of David W. Patten
    went to disperse this mob. A conflict ensued, in which Captain
    Patten and two of his men were killed, and others wounded. [6] A
    mob party, from two to three hundred in number, many of whom are
    supposed to have come from Chariton county, fell on our people,
    and, notwithstanding they begged for quarters, shot down and killed
    eighteen, as they would so many wild beasts.

    They were finally compelled to flee from those counties; and on the
    11th October, 1838, they sought safety by that means, with their
    families, {87} leaving many of their effects behind. That they had
    previously applied to the constituted authorities of Missouri for
    protection, but in vain.

    The society were pursued by the mob, conflicts ensued, deaths
    occurred on each side, and finally a force was organized under the
    authority of the Governor of the state of Missouri, with orders to
    drive us from the State, _or exterminate us_.

    Abandoned and attacked by those to whom we had looked for
    _protection,_ we determined to make no further resistance, but
    submit to the authorities of the State and yield to our fate,
    however hard it might be. Several members of the society were
    arrested and imprisoned on a charge of treason against the State:
    and the rest, amounting to above 14,000 souls, fled into the other
    States, principally into Illinois, where they now reside.

    Your memorialists would further state that they have heretofore
    petitioned your honorable body, praying redress for the injuries
    set forth in this memorial; but the committee to whom our petition
    was referred reported, in substance, that the General Government
    had no power in the case, and that we must look for relief to the
    courts and the legislature of Missouri.

    In reply, your memorialists would beg leave to state that they
    have repeatedly appealed to the authorities of Missouri in vain;
    that though they are American citizens, at all times ready to obey
    the laws and support the institutions of the country, none of us
    would dare enter Missouri for any such purpose, or for any purposes
    whatever.

    Our property was seized by the mob or lawlessly confiscated by the
    State; and we were forced, at the point of the bayonet, to sign
    deeds of trust relinquishing our property. But the exterminating
    order of the Governor of Missouri is still in force, and we dare
    not return to claim out just rights. The widows and orphans of
    those slain, who could legally sign no deeds of trust, dare not
    return to claim the inheritance left them by their murdered parents.

    It is true the Constitution of the United States gives to us, in
    common with all other native or adopted citizens, the right to
    enter and settle in Missouri; but an executive order has been
    issued to exterminate us if we enter the State, and a part of the
    Constitution becomes a nullity, so far as we are concerned.

    Had any foreign state or power committed a similar outrage upon us
    we cannot for a moment doubt that the strong arm of the General
    Government would have been stretched out to redress our wrongs; and
    we flatter ourselves that the same power will either redress our
    grievances or shield us from harm in our efforts to regain our lost
    property, which we fairly purchased from the General Government.

    Finally, your memorialists pray your honorable body to take their
    {88} wrongs into consideration, receive testimony in the case, and
    grant such relief as by the Constitution and laws you may have
    power to give.

    And your memorialists will ever pray.

Joseph Smith, the Mayor, made some remarks, and his Appeal to the Green
Mountain Boys was read by William W. Phelps, as follows:--

    _President Smith's Appeal to his Native State--Vermont._

    I was born in Sharon, Vermont, in 1805, where the first quarter of
    my life grew with the growth and strengthened with the strength
    of that "first-born" State of the "United Thirteen." From the old
    "French War" to the final consummation of American Independence, my
    fathers, heart to heart, and shoulder to shoulder, with the noble
    fathers of our liberty, fought and bled; and with the most of that
    venerable band of patriots, they have gone to rest, bequeathing
    a glorious country, with all her inherent rights, to millions of
    posterity. Like other honest citizens, I not only (when manhood
    came,) sought my own peace, prosperity, and happiness, but also
    the peace, prosperity, and happiness of my friends; and, with all
    the rights and realm before me, {89} and the revelations of Jesus
    Christ to guide me into all truth, I had good reasons to enter into
    the blessings and privileges of an American citizen, the rights
    of a Green Mountain Boy, unmolested, and enjoy life and religion
    according to the most virtuous and enlightened customs, rules, and
    etiquette of the nineteenth century. But, to the disgrace of the
    United States, it is not so. These rights and privileges, together
    with a large amount of property, have been wrested from me, and
    thousands of my friends, by lawless mobs in Missouri, supported by
    executive authority; and the crime of plundering our property, and
    the unconstitutional and barbarous act of our expulsion, and even
    the inhumanity of murdering men, women, and children, have received
    the_ pass-word of "justifiable"_ by legislative enactments; and the
    horrid deeds, doleful and disgraceful as they are, have been paid
    for by Government.

    In vain have we sought for redress of grievances and a restoration
    to our rights in the courts and legislature of Missouri. In vain
    have we sought for our rights and the remuneration for our property
    in the halls of Congress and at the hands of the President. The
    only consolation yet experienced from these highest tribunals and
    _mercy-seats_ of our bleeding country _is that our cause is just,
    but the Government has no power to redress us_.

    Our arms were forcibly taken from us by those Missouri marauders;
    and, in spite of every effort to have them returned, the State of
    Missouri still retains them: and the United States militia law,
    with this fact before the Government, still compels us to military
    duty; and, for a lack of said arms, the law _forces us to pay
    fines._ As Shakespeare would say "_thereby hangs a tale._"

    Several hundred thousand dollars' worth of land in Missouri was
    purchased at the United States Land Offices in that district of
    country and the money, without doubt, has been appropriated to
    strengthen the army and navy, or increase the power and glory
    of the nation in some other way. And notwithstanding Missouri
    has robbed and mobbed me and twelve or fifteen thousand innocent
    inhabitants, murdered hundreds, and expelled the residue, at
    the point of the bayonet, without law, contrary to the express
    language of the Constitution of the United States and every State
    in the Union, and contrary to the custom and usage of civilized
    nations, and especially one holding up the motto, "_The asylum of
    the oppressed._" yet the comfort we receive to raise our wounded
    bodies and invigorate our troubled spirits, on account of such
    immense sacrifices of life, property, patience, and right, and as
    an equivalent for the enormous taxes we are compelled to pay to
    support these functionaries in a dignified manner, after we have
    petitioned and pleaded with tears, and been showed like a caravan
    of foreign animals, for the peculiar gratification of connoiseurs
    in humanity, that flare {90} along in public life like lamps upon
    lamp-posts, because they are better calculated for the schemes of
    the night than for the scenes of the day, is, as President Van
    Buren said, _Your cause is just, but Government has no power to
    redress you_!

    No wonder, after the Pharisee's prayer, the publican smote his
    breast and said, "_Lord be merciful to me a sinner!"_ What must the
    manacled nations think of freemen's rights in the land of liberty?
    [7] * * *

    Now, therefore, having failed in every attempt to obtain
    satisfaction at the tribunals, where all men seek for it, according
    to the rules of right, I am compelled to appeal to the honor
    and patriotism of my native State--to the clemency and valor
    of "Green Mountain Boys;" for throughout the various periods
    of the world, whenever a nation, kingdom, state, family, or
    individual has received an insult or an injury from a superior
    force, (unless satisfaction was made,) it has been the custom
    to call in the aid of friends to assist in obtaining redress.
    For proof we have only to refer to the recovery of Lot and his
    effects by Abraham in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, or to turn
    to the relief afforded by France and Holland for the achievement
    of the Independence of these United States, without bringing up
    the great bulk of historical facts, rules, laws, decrees, and
    treaties, and Bible records, by which nations have been governed,
    to show that mutual alliance for the general benefit of mankind
    to retaliate and repel foreign aggressions. To punish and prevent
    home wrongs, when the conservators of justice and the laws have
    failed to afford a remedy, are not only common and in the highest
    sense justifiable and wise, but they are also poorer expedients to
    promote the enjoyment of equal rights, the pursuit of happiness,
    the preservation of life, and the benefit of posterity.

    With all these facts before me, and a pure desire to ameliorate the
    condition of the poor and unfortunate among men, and, if possible,
    to entice all men from evil to good, and with firm reliance that
    God will reward the just, I have been stimulated to call upon my
    native State for a "union of all honest men," and to appeal to the
    valor of the "Green Mountain Boys" by all honorable methods and
    means to assist me in obtaining justice from Missouri, not only for
    the property she has stolen and confiscated, the murders she has
    committed among my friends, and for our expulsion from the State,
    but also to humble and chastise or abase her for the disgrace she
    has brought upon constitutional liberty until she atones for her
    sins.

    I appeal also to the fraternity of brethren who are bound by
    kindred ties to assist a brother in distress in all cases where it
    can be done according {91} to the rules of order, to extend the
    boon of benevolence and protection in avenging the Lord of His
    enemies, as if a Solomon, a Hiram, a St. John, or a Washington
    raised his hands before a wondering world, and exclaimed, "My life
    for his!" Light, liberty, and virtue forever!

    I bring this appeal before my native State, for the solemn reason
    that an injury has been done, and crimes have been committed,
    which a sovereign State, of the Federal compact, one of the great
    family of _"E pluribus unum,"_ refuses to compensate, by consent
    of parties, rules of law, customs of nations, or in any other way.
    I bring it also because the National Government has fallen short
    of affording the necessary relief, as before stated, _for want of
    power,_ leaving a large body of her own free citizens, whose wealth
    went freely into her treasury for lands, and whose gold and silver
    for taxes still fills the pockets of her dignitaries "in ermine and
    lace," defrauded, robbed, plundered, ravished, driven, exiled, and
    banished from the "Independent Republic of Missouri!"

    And in the appeal let me say, Raise your towers, pile your
    monuments to the skies, build your steam frigates, spread
    yourselves far and wide, and open the iron eyes of your bulwarks
    by sea and land; and let the towering church steeples marshal
    the country like the dreadful splendor of an army with bayonets.
    But remember the flood of Noah; remember the fate of Sodom and
    Gomorrah; remember the dispersion and confusion at the tower of
    Babel; remember the destruction of Pharaoh and his hosts; remember
    the handwriting upon the wall, _"Mene, mene, tekel upharsin;"_
    remember the angel's visit to Sennacherib, and the one hundred and
    eighty-five thousand Assyrians; remember the end of the Jews and
    Jerusalem, and remember the Lord Almighty will avenge the blood of
    His Saints that now crimsons the skirts of Missouri! Shall wisdom
    cry aloud, and her speech not be heard?

    Has the majesty of American liberty sunk into such vile servitude
    and oppression, that justice has fled? Have the glory and influence
    of a Washington, an Adams, a Jefferson, a Lafayette, and a host
    of others, forever departed; and the wrath of a Cain, a Judas,
    and a Nero whirled forth in the heraldry of hell, to sprinkle our
    garments with blood, and lighten the darkness of midnight with the
    blaze of our dwellings? Where is the patriotism of '76? Where is
    the virtue of our forefathers? and where is the sacred honor of
    freemen!

    Must we, because we believe in the fullness of the Gospel of Jesus
    Christ, the administration of angels, and the communion of the Holy
    Ghost, like the Prophets and Apostles of old,--must we be mobbed
    with impunity, be exiled from our habitations and property without
    {92} remedy, murdered without mercy, and Government find the
    weapons and pay the vagabonds for doing the jobs, and give them the
    plunder into the bargain? Must we, because we believe in enjoying
    the constitutional privilege and right of worshiping Almighty God
    according to the dictates of our own consciences, and because we
    believe in repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins, the
    gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, the resurrection
    of the dead, the millennium, the day of judgment, and the Book of
    Mormon as the history of the aborigines of this continent,--must
    we be expelled from the institutions of our country, the rights of
    citizenship and the graves of our friends and brethren, and the
    Government lock the gate of humanity and shut the door of redress
    against us? If so, farewell freedom! adieu to personal safety! and
    let the red hot wrath of an offended God purify the nation of such
    sinks of corruption; for that realm is hurrying to ruin where vice
    has the power to expel virtue.

    My father, who stood several times in the battles of the American
    Revolution, till his companions in arms had been shot dead at
    his feet, was forced from his home in Far West, Missouri, by
    those civilized--or satanized--savages, in the dreary season of
    winter, to seek a shelter in another State; and the vicissitudes
    and sufferings consequent to his flight brought his honored grey
    head to the grave a few months after. And my youngest brother
    also, in the vigor and bloom of youth, from his great exposure and
    fatigue in endeavoring to assist his parents on their journey, (I
    and my brother Hyrum being in chains, in dungeons, in Missouri,
    _where they tried to feed us with--human flesh_) was likewise
    so debilitated that he found a premature grave shortly after
    my father; and my mother, too, though she yet lingers among
    us, from her extreme exposure in that dreadful tragedy, was
    filled with rheumatic affections and other diseases, which leave
    her no enjoyment of health. She is sinking in grief and pain,
    broken-hearted, from Missouri persecution.

    O death! wilt thou not give to every honest man a heated dart to
    sting those wretches while they pollute the land? And O Grave! wilt
    thou not _open the trap door_ to the pit of ungodly men, that they
    may stumble in?

    I appeal to the "Green Mountain Boys" of my native State to rise in
    the majesty of virtuous freemen, and by all honorable means help
    to bring Missouri to the bar of justice. If there is one whisper
    from the spirit of Ethan Allen, or a gleam from the shade of a
    General Stark, let it mingle with our sense of honor and fire our
    bosoms for the cause of suffering innocence, for the reputation of
    our disgraced country, and for the glory of God; and may all the
    earth bear me witness, if Missouri--blood-stained Missouri, escapes
    the due merit of her {93} crimes--the vengeance she so justly
    deserves--that Vermont is a hypocrite, a _coward_ and this nation
    the hotbed of political demagogues!

    I make this appeal to the sons of liberty of my native State for
    help to frustrate the wicked designs of sinful men. I make it to
    hush the violence of mobs. I make it to cope with the unhallowed
    influence of wicked men in high places. I make it to resent the
    insult and injury made to an innocent, unoffending people, by a
    lawless ruffian State. I make it to obtain justice where law is
    put at defiance. I make it to wipe off the stain of blood from our
    nation's escutcheon. I make it to show presidents, governors, and
    rulers prudence. I make it to fill honorable men with discretion.
    I make it to teach senators wisdom. I make it to teach judges
    justice. I make it to point clergymen to the path of virtue. And
    I make it to turn the hearts of this nation to the truth and
    realities of pure and undefiled religion, that they may escape the
    perdition of ungodly men; and Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is my
    Great Counselor.

    Wherefore let the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble, the
    poor and the needy, the bond and the free, both black and white,
    take heed to their ways, and a leave to the knowledge of God, and
    execute justice and judgment upon the earth in righteousness, and
    prepare to meet the judge of the quick and the dead, for the hour
    of His coming is nigh.

  And I must go on as the herald of grace,
     Till the wide-spreading conflict is over.
  And burst through the curtains of tyrannic night;
     Yes, I must go on to gather our race,
  Till the high blazing flame of Jehovah
     Illumines the globe as a triumph of right.

    As a friend of equal rights to all men, and a messenger of the
    everlasting Gospel of Jesus Christ, I have the honor to be,

    Your devoted servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

Sidney Rigdon spoke.

Parley P. Pratt confessed he was wrong in one thing in Missouri; that
is, he left alive, and left them alive; and asked forgiveness, and
promised never to do so again.

Parley P. Pratt offered to deliver the President's "Appeal to the Green
Mountain Boys" to all the large towns in New York, if he could have a
copy.

The President offered a copy and it was voted that {94} Elder Pratt
shall have this mission granted him, and voted in addition that he go
to all the towns in Vermont.

The Chairman [Brigham Young] spoke.

The Mayor [President Smith] spoke. Said he rose to make a confession,
that he used all his influence to prevent the brethren from fighting
when mobbed in Missouri. If I did wrong, I will not do so any more. It
was a suggestion of the head. He would never do so again; but when the
mobs come upon you, kill them. I never will restrain you again, but
will go and help you.

The Chairman [Brigham Young] spoke again; acknowledged his wrong; said
he would never put his hand on Brother Hosea Stout's shoulder again to
hold him back when he was abused.

John Taylor spoke of Missouri; said he would never submit to such
treatment again.

Mayor [President Smith] spoke again. If I do not stand with those who
will stand by me in the hour of trouble and danger, without faltering,
I give you leave to shoot me. [8]

Mayor read a letter in reply to one he wrote to Henry Clay.

Parley P. Pratt stated that the history of the persecution was put into
the hand of Henry Clay.

{95} Moved by Joseph Smith, That every man in the meeting who could
wield a pen write an address to his mother country. Carried.

Mayor read the Memorial to Congress. The State rights doctrines are
what feed mobs. They are a dead carcass--a stink, and they shall ascend
up as a stink offering in the nose of the Almighty.

They shall be oppressed as they have oppressed us, not by "Mormons,"
but by others in power. They shall drink a drink offering, the
bitterest dregs, not from the "Mormons," but from a meaner source than
themselves. God shall curse them.

Adjourned till next Monday evening, early candle-light.

At ten, a.m., rode out with Mr. Jackson. At home most all day.

W. L. D. Ewing writes to Major John Bills--

    _Letter: W. L. D. Ewing, State Auditor, Illinois, to Major John
    Bills--Legion Affairs._

    The foregoing opinions constitute my reason for refusing to issue
    the warrants in your favor. I am not satisfied myself entirely
    of the correctness of the opinions of the Attorney-General. If
    you should be dissatisfied with the decision, I would advise you
    to raise the question before the Supreme Court, which will be in
    session on the 2nd Monday of December. I am the more anxious that
    this should be done because I wish to be satisfied whether I was
    correct or not in issuing warrants to you in the spring. Be pleased
    to advise me on the subject.

    Respectfully,

    W. L. D. EWING, Auditor.

    SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, Nov. 30, 1843.

    I have examined the claim of J. C. Bennett as brigade-inspector of
    the Nauvoo Legion, and it is my opinion that the claim should be
    disallowed.

    body of "independent military men" at Nauvoo, intended, no doubt,
    that all expenses, &c., except "their proportion of public arms,"
    should be defrayed by the city and its privileged Legion.

    They occupy a novel position, disconnected from the military
    communities of the whole State, and in no way subject to the
    regular military officers, possessing an exemption even from
    subjection to the general military laws, with a law-making power
    invested in their own Legion. It is not reasonable to suppose that
    the Legislature would confer so many exclusive favors, and yet pay
    those who profit by this condition of things as much as is paid to
    regular militia officers.

    In the absence of any express provision by law to authorize the
    payment of the claim, I can see nothing from which an authority of
    the kind could be derived, and therefore advise accordingly.

And copy of letter from J. N. McDougall to General W. L. D. Ewing:--

    _Letter: J. N. McDougall to State Auditor._

    SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, Nov. 30, 1843.

    _General W. L. D. Ewing, Auditor, &.c._--

    I have examined the claim of John Bills, brigade-major of the
    Nauvoo Legion, for services under the 53rd section of the militia
    law, and have arrived at the conclusion that the Nauvoo Legion
    are not to be considered as a part of the regular militia of this
    State, and that the general law has no further application to
    them than is expressly provided for in the law authorizing their
    organization. The law providing for the organization of the Legion
    making no provision for the payment of its officers by the State,
    it is my opinion that the above claim ought not to be audited.

    The Legion was organized by the City Council, is subject to
    their control for the purpose of enforcing their ordinances. It
    is entirely independent of the general military law, may have a
    different organization, make laws for its own government, and seems
    evidently designed to sustain the municipal authorities of Nauvoo.
    If there are expenses to be paid, the municipality of which they
    form a very important element, must meet them. I am, with great
    respect,

    Your obedient servant,

    J. N. McDOUGALL.

Mr. Ewing reported to Major Bills that the returns made {97} out [for
Mr. Bills], and sent to the State Department, were the best reports by
any brigade-major in the State, and did him great credit: the refusal
to pay him for his services is a mere pretext, as the Nauvoo Charter
requires that the Nauvoo Legion shall perform the same amount of duty
as is now or may hereafter be required of the regular militia of the
State, and shall be at the disposal of the Governor for the public
defense and the execution of the laws of the State, and be entitled to
their proportion of the State arms; and were it not for the prejudice
against us on account of our religion, his claim would have been paid
without a word of complaint.

Footnotes:

1. The omitted part of the letter is a paragraph in which are quoted
a number of foreign phrases from Egyptian, Hebrew, Greek, German,
Portuguese and other tongues; which are in no way germane to the
subject discussed, but are a mere pedantic display, doubtless admitted,
in this instance, in a spirit of humor by President Smith, as an
offset to Bennett's assumption of so lofty an intellect--a mind of "so
mathematical and philosophical a cast--that the divinity of Moses,"
etc., made no "impression" on him. The display of foreign phrases was
doubtless the work of W. W. Phelps, who had some smattering knowledge
of languages, which he was ever fond of displaying. Unfortunately
similar displays were injected into President Smith's appeal to his
native state--Vermont; and his paper, "Views of the Powers and Policy
of the Government of the United States." These injections were also
doubtless the work of Elder Phelps, who was one of the Prophet's clerks
and amanuenses when the documents named above were prepared. Because
these displays of pedantry mar these documents, and are in no way
germane to the subjects of which they treat, and are not really the
work of President Smith, they are omitted from the papers referred to
as published in this HISTORY, the omission being indicated by ellipses
signs.

2. Not in the blasphemous sense attributed to him by some anti-Mormon
writers; namely, that God was subordinate to him--his right hand
man (See Riley's "Founder of Mormonism" Ch. X); but in the sense of
the passage near the close of his address to "The Green Mountain
Boys" (this chapter)--"And Jesus Christ, the son of God, is my Great
Counselor"--reverently said.

3. The General Government finally constructed a canal around the rapids
at a cost of $4,582,000, completing the work in 1877. The canal is
seven and a half miles in length and has in it three locks, overcoming
the obstruction in river navigation which the Des Moines rapids in
early days presented. It is called the Des Moines Rapids Canal.

4. This Col. Frierson resided at Quincy, was a political representative
of John C. Calhoun, then an active aspirant for the presidency of the
United States. See letter of Joseph L. Heywood, pp. 62, 63.

5. The reason Col. John Frierson interested himself in this matter
was that Hon. R. B. Rhett a representative in the National Congress
from South Carolina, and a political friend of John C. Calhoun, had
expressed a willingness to present to Congress a memorial for a redress
of grievances suffered by the Saints in Missouri; and of course all
this in the interest of Calhoun as candidate for President. See pp.
62-63; also _Nauvoo Neighbor_ for the 5th June, 1844.

6. This is an error. Col. Frierson has confounded two incidents--the
"Battle" at Crooked River, and a movement in Daviess county. General
Doniphan gave no orders in respect of the skirmish in which David
Patten lost his life, usually called the "Battle of Crooked River;" but
he and also General Park gave some orders to Col. Wight d Col. Hinkle
in relation to movements of militia in Daviess County against Millport
and Gallatin. (See Vol. III, Ch. XII.)

7. The omission here indicated is the paragraph of foreign phrases not
germane to the matter as explained in the footnote at page 75.

8. Relative to the spirit of this meeting in Nauvoo on the 29th
of November, 1843; and also of many of the articles published as
Editorials, and letters that were written about this time to public
men, the reader should be reminded that these leading brethren of the
Church were speaking and writing under a great stress of feeling--under
a sense of outraged justice. Their minds had been refreshed and
their feelings again wrought up by the detailed recital of the acts
of injustice endured in Missouri by the Memorial to congress drawn
up by Colonel Frierson; and under such circumstances it is scarcely
to be expected that strong men will not give expression to the
vehemence they feel. Edmund Burke once said in defense of the rashness
expressed in both speech and action of some of the patriots of the
American Revolution, that "_It is not fair to judge the temper or the
disposition of any man or set of men when they are composed and at
rest from their conduct or there expressions in a state of disturbance
and irritation."_ The justice of Burke's assertion has never been
questioned, and without any wresting whatsoever it may be applied to
the prominent Church leaders on the occasion of this meeting at Nauvoo;
and, moreover, they saw again forming those mobocratic tendencies in
Illinois from which they had suffered in Missouri.

OFFERED AS UNITED STATES TROOPS.

_Friday, December 1, 1843.--_At home. In the evening, walking out and
administering to the sick.

At noon, Dr. Willard Richards called on me to get a petition to
Congress for an appropriation to improve the Rapids.

[Sidenote: Progress of the Work.]

I continue to receive letters from Elders in the different States,
giving news of the progress of the work.

Clear and cold day. Some ice floating in the river.

_Saturday 2.--_Prayer-meeting from one to six p.m., in the assembly
room over the store. Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, Wilford Woodruff,
George A. Smith, and Orson Spencer received their endowments and
further instructions in the Priesthood. About thirty-five persons
present.

A conference was held at Alexander in Genesee county, New York. Ten
branches, containing 44 Elders and 206 members, were represented. Two
High Priests, one Seventy, 21 Elders and one Deacon present.

[Sidenote: Hyrum Smith Meets with an Accident.]

_Sunday, 3.--_I arrived at the assembly room [1] about noon: found
all present, except Hyrum and his wife. He had slipped and turned his
knee-joint backward, and sprained the large muscle of his leg, and I
had been ministering unto him. Emma had been unwell during the night.
After the meeting was organized, William W. Phelps {99} read my "Appeal
to the Green Mountain Boys," which was dedicated by prayer after all
had spoken upon it. We also prayed for Nathan Pratt, who was very sick,
Hyrum, and others. I afterwards instructed them in the things of the
Priesthood.

_Monday, 4.--_At six in the evening, I attended the adjourned meeting
of citizens in the assembly room, which was crowded with a select
congregation. Many could not get admission. There were two Missourians
present. I made some observations at the opening of the meeting,
requested them to be calm and cool, but let the spirit of '76 burn in
their bosoms, and when occasion requires, say little, but act; and when
the mob comes, mow a hole through them.

My "Appeal to the Green Mountain Boys" was read by W. W. Phelps.

Elder Parley P. Pratt read his "Appeal to the State of New York."

[Sidenote: Number of the Prophet's Vexatious Lawsuits]

My clerk, Willard Richards, read the memorial to Congress, when the
assembly unanimously voted their approbation of the memorial, when
I spoke two-and-a-half hours, relating many circumstances which
transpired in Missouri, not mentioned in the memorial. I have already
had thirty-eight vexatious lawsuits, and have paid Missouri $150,000
for land. I borrowed $500 of Judge Young in Washington, to pay the
expenses of the party that accompanied me, and had to borrow of others.

Daniel Avery and his son were kidnapped from the neighborhood of Warsaw
by a company of Missourians, assisted by some anti-Mormons of this
county, and carried into Missouri. [2]

_Tuesday, 5.--_Six p.m., met the Twelve, also Phelps, Clayton, and
Turley, in council, in the office, on important business.

{100} Advised the Twelve to raise money to send to Elder Hyde, who is
east, for him to get paper to print the Doctrine and Covenants, and get
new type and metal for stereotyping the same.

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss.

    On the sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand
    eight hundred and forty-three, came Delmore Chapman before me,
    Joseph Smith, mayor of said city; and after being duly sworn,
    deposeth and saith that on the nineteenth day of November, 1843, a
    man named Richardson came to one of his neighbors living in Bear
    Creek precinct, in the county of Hancock, named Philander Avery,
    and enticed him to the Mississippi at Warsaw, by false pretenses;
    and from thence by a company he was forced over the river and
    taken to Monticello jail; and that on the second day of December,
    some of the same party and others came to the aforesaid Bear Creek
    and kidnapped Daniel Avery, the father of the aforesaid Philander
    Avery, and by force of arms hurried him across the said Mississippi
    river into the State of Missouri, to aforesaid jail at Monticello,
    Lewis county, where your said affiant verily believes they are both
    now incarcerated illegally and inhumanly in prison; and further
    report says that some of them are to come to Nauvoo next, to kidnap
    Nelson Turner; and further your affiant saith not.

    DELMORE CHAPMAN.

    Subscribed and sworn to before me, this sixth day of December, 1843.

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

Upon which I wrote to his Excellency Thomas Ford:--

    LETTER--PRESIDENT JOSEPH SMITH TO GOVERNOR FORD.

    NAUVOO, December 6, 1843.

    SIR:--The enclosed affidavit is forwarded to your Excellency for
    instructions to know what shall be done in the premises. I shall
    act according to the best of my judgment, constitutionally, till I
    receive your instructions, and in the meantime shall forward, as
    soon as they can be had, all the facts relative to the case as a
    suitable person will go {101} immediately to the place and get the
    necessary affidavits. Send your instructions by the bearer.

    Respectfully, I have the honor to be,

    Your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    Lieutenant-General of N. L.

    P. S. Shall any portion of the Legion be called out?

    N. B. An express has just reached me that Governor Reynolds will
    make another demand for me. I rely on the honor of Illinois, for
    no writ can legally issue against me. I have suffered from their
    insatiable thirst for my blood long enough, and want the peace of
    my family to remain undisturbed.

_Wednesday, 6_.--Esquire Goodwin and others, not members of the Church,
petitioned the Governor not to help Missouri to persecute the Saints.

_Thursday, 7.--_At eleven a.m. a meeting of the citizens of Nauvoo was
held. The minutes of which I extract from the _Neighbor_ as follows:--

    PUBLIC MEETING AT NAUVOO.

    At a meeting of the citizens of Nauvoo, held near the Temple, on
    the 7th day of December, 1843, Alpheus Cutler was called to the
    chair, and Willard Richards appointed secretary; whereupon, after
    the object of the meeting was stated, a committee of three--namely,
    W. W. Phelps, Reynolds Cahoon, and Hosea Stout, were appointed to
    draft a preamble and resolutions expressive of the sentiments of
    the people of the city of Nauvoo relative to the repeated unlawful
    demands by the State of Missouri for the body of General Joseph
    Smith, as well as the common, cruel practice of kidnapping citizens
    of Illinois, and forcing them across the Mississippi river, and
    then incarcerating them in the dungeons or prisons of Missouri. And
    after a few minutes' absence they returned with the following:--

    RESOLUTIONS.

    Whereas, the State of Missouri, with the Governor at the head,
    continues to make demands upon the executive of Illinois for the
    body of General Joseph Smith, as we verily believe, to keep up a
    system of persecution against the Church of Latter-day Saints,
    for the purpose of justifying the said State of Missouri in her
    diabolical, unheard of, cruel and unconstitutional warfare against
    said Church of Latter-day Saints, and which she has practiced
    during the last twelve years, whereby {102} many have been
    murdered, mobbed and ravished, and the whole community expelled
    from the State:

    And also to heave dust in the eyes of the nation and the world,
    while she, as a State, with the Government to back her, continues
    to slip over the river to steal the property of the Latter-day
    Saints, and kidnap the members of said Church to glut her
    vengeance, malice, revenge, and avarice, and to make slaves of the
    said captives or murder them: Therefore,

    Resolved unanimously: As we do know that Joseph Smith is not guilty
    of any charge made against him by the said State of Missouri,
    but is a good, industrious, well-meaning, and worthy citizen of
    Illinois, and an officer that does faithfully and impartially
    administer the laws of the State, that we as citizens of Illinois,
    crave the protection of the Constitution and laws of the country
    as an _aegis_ to shield him, the said General Joseph Smith, from
    such cruel persecutions, beseeching the Governor of Illinois not
    to issue any more writs against the said General Joseph Smith, or
    other Latter-day Saints (unless they are guilty), but to let the
    Latter-day Saints "breathe awhile like other men," and enjoy the
    liberty guaranteed to every honest citizen by the Magna Charta of
    our common country.

    Resolved, That as citizens of the State of Illinois, we solicit
    the attention of the Governor and officers generally of the State
    to take some lawful means and measures to regain the citizens that
    have been kidnapped by the Missourians, and to prevent the said
    Missourians and government from committing further violence upon
    the citizens of Illinois.

    Resolved, as the sense of this meeting, That, according to the true
    meaning of the law, those citizens of any section of country who do
    not rise up as virtuous freemen (when any portion of inhabitants
    congregate or combine to injure, slander, or deprive another
    portion of their rights,) and magnify the law, to clear themselves
    from such unhallowed attempts to subvert order and law, that they
    by their silence make themselves accessories of the crime of such
    unlawful assemblage or outrageous individuals.

    Resolved, unanimously, That we solicit the Governor by all
    honorable means to grant us peace, for we will have it.

    ALPHEUS CUTLER, Chairman.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, Secretary.

In the afternoon, Lucien Woodworth started with the papers to the
Governor, and the petition from Goodwin and others, and Delmore
Chapman's affidavit.

[Sidenote: Provision for German Meetings.]

{103} The German brethren met at the assembly room at six p.m., and
choose Bishop Daniel Garn as their Presiding Elder, and organized to
have preaching in their native language.

Directed copies of my Appeal to the various authorities of Vermont and
the United States.

[Sidenote: Precautionary Steps against Missouri Invasion]

_Friday, 8.--_At eleven a.m. I went to my office and gave instructions
to my clerk for the drawing of a draft of a dam on the Mississippi
river, an directed that the city council be called at four this
afternoon to make preparations for any invasion from Missouri.

Willard Richards and Philip B. Lewis made an affidavit, which I
insert:--

    _Richards' and Lewis' Affidavit_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss.

    On the 8th day of December, 1843, came Willard Richards and Philip
    B. Lewis before me, Joseph Smith, Mayor of said city, and after
    being duly sworn, depose and say that they have been informed
    that two men have been kidnapped recently by the Missourians, in
    connection with some of the lawless inhabitants of the county of
    Hancock, and that rumors are now afloat that it is the intention of
    said lawless persons, in connection with the aforesaid Missourians,
    to kidnap some of the citizens of this city; and further your
    affiants would state that they are of opinion, to prevent
    difficulties of such a vexatious nature, that something should be
    done to secure the peace of this city from being disturbed. And
    further your affiants say not.

    WILLARD RICHARDS,

    PHILIP B. LEWIS.

    Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 8th day of December, 1843.

    W. W. PHELPS, Clerk.

Whereupon I issued the following notification;--

    _An Order to the City Marshal_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss.

    _To the Marshal of said City, Greeting_:--

    Whereas complaint has been made to me upon oath, that some persons
    have been kidnapped by the Missourians, in connection with {104}
    some of the lawless inhabitants of Hancock county, and that
    threats have been made that some of the citizens of Nauvoo will be
    kidnapped or arrested, and forcibly carried away from said city
    without being allowed the benefit of the writ of _habeas corpus_,
    according to the ordinance in such case made and provided, you
    will therefore take the necessary measures to have the rights of
    the citizens of this city held sacred, and the ordinances of said
    city duly carried into full force and effect. To which end, should
    you judge that the peace and safety of the city require it, you
    are further notified to call for a suitable portion of the Nauvoo
    Legion to be in complete readiness to compel obedience to the
    ordinances of the said city.

    Given under my hand and seal this 8th day of December, 1843.

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor,

    W. W. PHELPS, Clerk, M. C.

In consequence thereof, I received from the City Marshal;--

    _The City Marshal's Reply_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, December 8, 1843.

    SIR:--Your order to have the ordinances of this city fully carried
    into effect will be duly attended to; but in order to so do, it
    will be necessary for you as Mayor of the city, to issue orders
    to Major General Wilson Law for a suitable portion of the Nauvoo
    Legion to be in readiness to _compel obedience_ to said ordinances,
    if necessary.

    Respectfully, &c.,

    HENRY G. SHERWOOD, City Marshal.

    _To Joseph Smith, Mayor_.

And I issued:--

    _Mayor's Order to the Commander of the Nauvoo Legion_.

    "HEADQUARTERS NAUVOO LEGION,

    CITY OF NAUVOO, Dec. 8, 1843.

    The Marshal of this city having made a demand of me for a suitable
    portion of the Nauvoo Legion to protect the rights of the citizens
    and carry the ordinances of said city into full effect, you are
    hereby directed and required to hold in readiness such portions of
    the said Nauvoo Legion, which you have the honor to command, as may
    be necessary to compel obedience to the ordinances of said city and
    secure the peace of the citizens, and call them out, if occasion
    require, without further notice.

    With due regard, I have the honor to be

    Your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    Lieutenant-General. N. L.

    _Major-General Wilson Law,_

    Commanding Nauvoo Legion.

{105} Four p.m., attended City Council, which passed "An extra
ordinance for the extra case of Joseph Smith and others."

    _Special Ordinance in the Prophet's Case, vs. Missouri_.

    Whereas, Joseph Smith has been three times arrested and three
    times acquitted upon writs founded upon supposed crimes or charges
    preferred by the State of Missouri, which acquittals were made
    from investigations upon writs of _habeas corpus_--namely one in
    the United States Court for the district of Illinois, one in the
    Circuit Court of the State of Illinois, and one in the Municipal
    Court of Nauvoo:

    And whereas, a _nolle prosequi_ has once been entered in the courts
    of Missouri upon all the cases of Missouri against Joseph Smith and
    others:

    And whereas, there appears to be a determined resolution by the
    State of Missouri to continue these unjust, illegal, and murderous
    demands for the body of General Joseph Smith:

    And whereas, it has become intolerable to be thus continually
    harassed and robbed of our money to defray the expenses of these
    prosecutions:

    And whereas, according to the Constitution of Illinois, "all men
    are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent
    and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and
    defending life and liberty, and of acquiring, possessing, and
    protecting property and reputation, and pursuing their own
    happiness:"

    And whereas, it is our bounden duty, by all common means, if
    possible, to put a stop to such vexatious lawsuits and save
    expense: Therefore--

    Section 1. Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of
    Nauvoo, according to the intent and meaning of the Charter for the
    "benefit and convenience" of Nauvoo, that hereafter, if any person
    or persons shall come with process, demand, or requisition, founded
    upon the aforesaid Missouri difficulties, to arrest said Joseph
    Smith, he or they so offending shall be subject to be arrested by
    any officer of the city, with or without process, and tried by the
    Municipal Court, upon testimony, and, if found guilty, sentenced to
    imprisonment in the city prison for life; which convict or convicts
    can only be pardoned by the Governor, with the consent of the Mayor
    of said city.

    Section 2. And be it further ordained that the preceding section
    shall apply to the case of every and all persons that may be
    arrested, demanded, or required upon any charge founded in the
    aforesaid Missouri difficulties.

    Section 3. And be it further ordained that the jury that makes the
    presentment, in any case above specified, shall not, nor either of
    them, {106} act as jurors on the final trial; but the trial shall
    be conducted according to the fifth and sixth articles of the
    amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

    Passed December 8, 1843.

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, Recorder. [3]

The City Council also passed "An ordinance to erect a dam in the
Mississippi river, and for other purposes."

    _Ordinance Providing for the Erection of a Dam in the Mississippi_.

    Section 1. Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of
    Nauvoo, that Joseph Smith and his successors for the term of
    perpetual succession are hereby authorized and empowered to erect
    a dam, of suitable height to propel mills and machinery, from
    any point within the limits of said city and below the Nauvoo
    House, and in a proper direction to reach the island this side
    of Montrose; but not to interfere with the main channel of the
    Mississippi river.

    Section 2. And be it further ordained that the said Joseph Smith
    and his successors are further authorized to erect north of the
    aforesaid island, a dam, pier, or breakwater to intersect the
    sandbar above.

    Section 3. Be it further ordained that said Joseph Smith and
    his successors are also authorized and have full liberty to use
    the said dam and water for the purpose of propelling mills and
    machinery, and shall be governed in their rates of toll and rules
    of manufactory by ordinance of said city.

    Section 4. And be it further ordained that the said Joseph Smith
    and his successors are further authorized and empowered to use the
    space within the limits of the said dam as a harbor or basin for
    steamboats and other water craft; and for which purpose they may
    construct docks, wharfs, and landings, and receive such fees for
    wharfage as may be regulated by ordinance of said city.

    Section 5. And be it further ordained that said Joseph Smith and
    his successors are further authorized to build an embankment on the
    east side of the aforesaid island, to connect the said dam with the
    pier on the north, and to use the top of said dam for a public road
    or highway, receiving for compensation from those who cross upon it
    such rates as may be allowed by ordinance of said city.

    Passed December 8, 1843.

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, Recorder.

[Sidenote: Petition for Nauvoo to Be Placed under the General
Government]

{107} I suggested to the Council the idea of petitioning Congress to
receive the City of Nauvoo under the protection of the United States
Government, to acknowledge the Nauvoo Legion as U. S. troops, and to
assist in fortifications and other purposes, and that a messenger be
sent to Congress for this purpose at the expense of the city.

Messrs. John Taylor, Orson Spencer, and Orson Pratt were appointed a
committee to draft a memorial according to my suggestions.

    PUBLIC MEETING AT NAUVOO MAKING AN APPEAL TO THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT
    ON SUNDRY LOCAL AFFAIRS.

    At a very large meeting of the citizens of Nauvoo, held at the
    corner of Main and Water streets, Mr. Heber C. Kimball was elected
    chairman, and John M. Bernhisel appointed secretary. Mr. George
    A. Smith having made a few observations, Mr. John Taylor read the
    preamble and resolutions of a meeting held at the temple, on the
    7th instant; also an ordinance entitled "An extra ordinance for
    the extra case of Joseph Smith and others," recently passed by
    the City Council of the City of Nauvoo; likewise the fifth and
    sixth articles of the amendments of the Constitution of the United
    States, and the opinion of the Attorney-General of the State of
    Illinois on the subject of the organization of the Nauvoo Legion,
    he being of the opinion that said Legion was disconnected from the
    military communities of the whole State, and in no way subject to
    the regular military officers, possessing an exemption even from
    subjection to the general military laws, with a law-making power
    vested in their own Legion.

    After some pertinent remarks by Mr. Taylor, General Joseph Smith
    briefly addressed the meeting. He dissented entirely from the
    opinion of the Attorney-General, and observed that it was stated in
    the Charter that the Legion was a part of the Militia of Illinois,
    and that his commission declared that he (General Smith) was the
    Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion and of the Militia of the
    State of Illinois; and as such, it was not only his duty to enforce
    the city ordinance, but the laws of the State, when called on by
    the Governor. He also stated that he had been informed that the
    Chief Magistrate of Missouri had it in {108} contemplation to make
    another requisition on the Governor of Illinois for him (Joseph
    Smith).

    The meeting then adjourned _sine die_.

    H. C. KIMBALL, Chairman.

    J. M. BERNHISEL, Secretary.

Received the following;--

    _Letter of Wilson Law to Joseph Smith Anent the Legion_.

    NAUVOO LEGION, NAUVOO CITY,

    December 9, 1843.

    _Lieutenant-General Joseph Smith_.

    In consequence of the orders I received from you "to hold in
    readiness a sufficient portion of the legion, &c.,--to make said
    forces efficient," it will be necessary to supply them with
    munitions of war, which of course must be done at the expense
    of the city. You will therefore please to give orders to the
    commandants of cohorts on their application to you on the city
    treasury for whatever amount you may think proper on the present
    occasion.

    Most respectfully your obedient servant,

    WILSON LAW,

    Major-General, N. L.

A prayer-meeting held this evening in the assembly room. I was not
present. Brigham Young presided. Several sick persons were prayed for.

[Sidenote: Avery Case--a Reminiscence of Missouri Days.]

By letter from J. White, deputy sheriff of Clark county, Missouri,
I learn that Mr. Daniel Avery is in Marion county prison, without
trial. The sheriff requests several men to go there as witnesses. It
is evidently a trap to get some more of our people into their power.
When I was in prison in Missouri, my witnesses were arrested before
they got into court to testify, except one, who was kicked out of the
court by an officer, Lieutenant Cook, who damned him, and ordered some
of his company to shoot him. After which, the State's attorney, Birch,
turned to me tauntingly, saying, "Why the hell don't you bring on your
witnesses?" and Judge King laughed at my discomfiture. The Saints have
had enough of Missouri mob justice.

{109} _Monday, 11._ The following affidavit will show that some of
the citizens of Illinois are so far fallen and so much governed by
mobocratic influence as to assist the Missouri wretches in their
hellish designs:--

    _Affidavit of Sission Chase--The Avery Case_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY. ss.

    On the 11th day of December, 1843, came Sission A. Chase before me
    Aaron Johnson, a Justice of the Peace of said county; and, after
    being duly sworn, deposeth and saith that the crime of kidnapping
    has been committed in Hancock County; and on the 2nd day of this
    present December, 1843, at the house of Schrench Freeman, about
    four miles and a half south of Warsaw, in said county, your said
    affiant heard a man by the name of John Elliot say that he was
    going a shooting turkeys. When asked what he was going to shoot
    them with, he showed a brace of pistols and a large hickory cane.
    Your affiant observed that he thought he could not kill turkeys
    with such weapons; and the said Elliot said that there was a
    certain cock he meant to take before night, and they would do for
    that. He, the said Elliot, went off, and your affiant did not see
    him till Sunday evening the 3rd, when your affiant asked the said
    Elliot if he had caught his turkey; and he replied, yes, the one
    he was after--a Mormon Elder. Your affiant then asked him who he
    was; and he said, Daniel Avery. Your affiant then asked the said
    Elliot what had been done with said Avery; and he said we put him
    on to a horse, tied his legs, and guarded him to the river, from
    whence, about ten o'clock at night, we took him into Clark county,
    Missouri, for stealing a horse four years ago, where they would try
    him; and if found guilty, they would then take him into another
    county, where there was a jail, as there was none in Clark county.
    On the 4th day of December, I asked him if they had writs or
    authority to take Mr. Avery. He replied, we all had writs. On the
    5th, said Elliot said he expected to get into difficulty on account
    of this scrape; but if any Mormon makes any business with me, I
    will shoot him. And further your affiant says not.

    NAUVOO, December 11, 1843.

    SIR:--I herewith forward your Excellency another affidavit on the
    subject of the late kidnapping, and shall continue [to do] the same
    as they {110} come to hand, expecting your cordial co-operation in
    the premises that the laws may be magnified and made honorable, and
    our lives held precious, our friends saved from jeopardy, and the
    captives freed.

    Respectfully, I have the honor to be

    Your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

[Sidenote: Nauvoo's Police Force Enlarged.]

Meetings were held and resolutions passed in all the wards of the city,
requesting the city council to raise a company of forty men to act as
police.

Last night, two ruffians, whose names are unknown, went to the house
of Brother Richard Badham--a farmer living on the prairie, robbed the
house of $4.50, threatened his life, stabbed him in the abdomen, when
part of his caul gushed out. Dr. John M. Bernhisel dressed his wounds
today, and he thinks there is a prospect of his recovering.

_Wednesday, 13.--_At home.

I insert an editorial from the _Neighbor_:--

    PUBLIC MEETING AT NAUVOO--THE AGGRESSIONS OF MISSOURI.

    It will be seen in another column that a public meeting was held
    in this place for the purpose of providing some remedy for the
    repeated aggressions of the State of Missouri; since which time an
    ordinance has been passed by the City Council to carry into effect
    that object, and to prevent the citizens of this place from being
    any longer imposed upon by the continued illegal proceedings of the
    state and citizens of Missouri.

    We think that it is high time that something should be done to
    screen ourselves from the continued aggressions of the meddling,
    troublesome, bloodthirsty herd; and we know of no means that will
    be more efficient and lawful than the one adopted.

    We have done good for evil long enough, in all conscience. We think
    that we have fulfilled the Scriptures every whit. They have smitten
    us on the one cheek, and we have turned the other, and they have
    smitten that also.

    We have also fulfilled the law, and more than fulfilled it. And
    for sake of peace, when we knew that we had violated no law, nor
    in anywise subjected ourselves to persecutions, we have endured
    the wrong patiently, without offering violence or in anywise
    injuring the heartless wretches who could be trusted with such a
    dishonorable document. {112} Those vagabonds have been suffered to
    prowl at large, and boast of their inglorious deeds in our midst;
    and no man has injured them, or said, Why do you so?

    The time, however, is now gone by for this mode of proceeding,
    and those vagabonds must keep within their own borders and let
    peaceable citizens alone, or receive the due merit of their crimes.
    We think that this ordinance passed by the City Council is wise,
    judicious, and well-timed, and is well calculated to protect
    peaceable citizens in their rights, and to prevent those lawless
    vagabonds from interfering with the rights of peaceable citizens.

    To those unacquainted with our relationship to Missouri, and the
    accumulated wrongs and repeated aggressions that we have received
    from the hands of that State, our language may appear harsh and
    ill timed; but those who are in possession of those facts know
    better. Their merciless, unrelenting, inhuman prosecutions and
    persecutions, from the time of our first settlement in that state
    until the present, have been wholly and entirely unprovoked and
    without the shadow of law.

    Joseph Smith has been suffered to be taken time and again by
    them; we say suffered, because he could not be legally and
    constitutionally taken, Joseph Smith never committed the crimes of
    which he is charged. He is an innocent man.

    But allowing their false, diabolical accusations to be true, what
    then? Does it follow that he is continually to be followed for the
    same offense? Verily no. The Constitution of the United States
    expressly says--"Nor shall any person be subject for the same
    offense to be _twice_ put in jeopardy of life or limb." And yet we
    find that the State of Missouri has put Joseph Smith in jeopardy
    no less than four or five times. He was tried once by a military
    tribunal in Missouri, and sentenced to be shot. He was afterwards
    tried by a pretended civil (mobocratic) court; and since then he
    has been several times apprehended, tried, and acquitted for the
    same offense, in this State, by Missouri requisitions.

    Is he still illegally and unconstitutionally to be held in abeyance
    by these miscreants? or shall we as freeborn American citizens,
    assert our rights, put the law in force upon those lawless,
    prowling vagabonds and say that he shall be free?

    Shall we suffer our pockets to be picked through the influence
    of these scoundrels eternally, by defending ourselves against
    vexatious lawsuits? or shall we take a more summary way, and by
    a legal course punish the aggressors, proclaim our freedom, and
    shield ourselves under the broad folds of the Constitution? The
    latter is the course for us to pursue.

    The ordinance passed by the City Council will secure this object;
    {113} and we are glad to find that the opinion of J. Lamborn,
    attorney general, and J. N. McDougall, correspond so much with
    our own--"That the Nauvoo Legion is an independent military
    organization, and is by law expressly required to sustain the
    municipal laws of Nauvoo.

    What are we to say about these kidnappers who infest our borders
    and carry away our citizens--those infernals in human shape?

    The whole European world has been engaged in a warfare against
    those who traffic in human blood. Negotiations have been made,
    treaties entered into, and fleets have been sent out, through the
    combined efforts of the nations, to put a stop to this inhuman
    traffic. But what would those nations think, if they were told the
    fact that in America--Republican America, the boasted cradle of
    liberty and land of freedom,--that those dealers in human flesh
    and blood, negro dealers and drivers, are allowed with impunity to
    steal white men, and those sons of liberty can obtain no redress.

    Great God! has it come to this, that freeborn American citizens
    must be kidnapped by negro drivers? What are our authorities doing!
    Why are not these wretches brought to justice? We have heard
    that one or two of the citizens of Illinois have been engaged in
    assisting these wretches. We shall try to find out who they are and
    their whereabouts and make them known; and then, if they are not
    brought to condign punishment, we shall say that justice has fled
    from Illinois."

_Thursday, 14.--_At home.

Philander Avery arrived in Nauvoo, having made his escape from his
kidnappers in Missouri.

I received the following milk-and-water letter from Governor Ford:--

    _Letter--Governor Ford to President Smith_.

    SPRINGFIELD, December 12, 1843.

    _General Joseph Smith_.

    SIR:--I have received your favor of the 6th instant, together with
    the proceedings of a public meeting of the citizens of Nauvoo, on
    the subject of the late kidnapping, by the people of Missouri and
    others, of two citizens of this State.

    You request to know if any portion of the Legion shall be called
    out. My answer is, No. The Militia cannot be called out, except in
    the cases specified by me in my letter to Governor Reynolds, dated
    in the month of August last, in which I took the ground that the
    Militia can only be called out to repel an invasion, suppress an
    insurrection, or on some extreme emergency; and not to suppress,
    prevent, or punish individual crimes. I still am of the opinion
    that the ground assumed by {114} me on that occasion is the true
    one. The prevention and punishment of individual offenses has been
    confided by the constitution and laws of this State to the judicial
    power, and not to the executive.

    If a citizen of the State has been kidnapped, or if property has
    been stolen from this State, and carried to the State of Missouri,
    those who have done either are guilty of an indictable offense. But
    the constitution and the laws have provided no means whereby either
    the person or property taken away can be returned, except by an
    appeal to the laws of Missouri. The Governor has no legal right to
    demand the return of either. The only power I would have would be
    simply this: If any of the guilty persons should be charged with
    larceny or kidnapping, by indictment or affidavit, duly certified,
    and with having fled to Missouri, then I would have the power,
    and it would become my duty to make a demand upon the Governor of
    Missouri for the surrender of the fugitives, to be tried by the
    courts of this State. I am fully satisfied that in ordinary cases
    this is all the power I would possess. It would be simply a power
    to be exercised in aid of the judicial power. Any other powers to
    be exercised by the Governor would be to make him a dictator and a
    despot. It is true that an extraordinary case might arise, in which
    the inhabitants of one State might arise in warlike and hostile
    array against those of another; in which case a state of war would
    exist, and then only could I interfere.

    I would advise your citizens to be strictly peaceable towards the
    people of Missouri. You ought to be aware that in every country
    individuals are liable to be visited with wrong, which the law
    is slow to redress, and _some of which are never redressed in
    this world._ This fact, however, has never been held to be a
    justification for violence, not warranted by law.

    If any of the people of Nauvoo should invade Missouri for the
    purpose of rescuing persons there in jail, the consequence would be
    that indictments would be presented against them, and demands made
    upon me for their arrest and surrender; which demands I would be
    compelled to obey, and thus they would be harassed by interminable
    demands and prosecutions; and very likely it would lead to a
    species of border warfare, which would be exceedingly annoying to
    a peaceable city, and, if you could be placed in the wrong, might
    lead to exceedingly unpleasant consequences with reference both to
    law and public opinion.

    You inform me that you are informed that Governor Reynolds is about
    to make a new demand for you; and you implore my protection from
    what you term this renewed persecution. In the month of August
    last, I was furnished by your friends with a very large amount of
    affidavits and evidence, said to be intended to show cause why
    no further writs should be issued against you. As they are very
    voluminous, {115} I have not yet read them, and probably never
    will, unless a new demand should be made; in which case they will
    receive a careful perusal; and you may rest assured that no steps
    will be taken by me but such as the constitution and laws may
    require.

    I am, very respectfully, &c.,

    THOMAS FORD.

[Sidenote: Comment of the Prophet on Governor Ford's attitude.]

It appears from this letter, that Governor Ford has never taken pains
to examine the evidences placed in his hands, "and probably never
will," in relation to the Missouri writs; and evidently as little
pains to examine the Constitution of the United States or even reflect
upon the ordinary principles of human rights, to suppose that a State,
after having, by a union of executive, judicial and military powers,
exterminated 15,000 of its innocent inhabitants, who were not even
charged with any crime, robbing them of all they possessed on earth,
murdering scores of men, women and children, and expelling all the
others from the State, among strangers, in mid-winter, destitute of
everything upon the face of the earth that could possibly have a
tendency to make life desirable, should be constitutionally entitled to
demand back from banishment persons who have thus suffered its absolute
decrees of exile, to satiate a yet unsatiated thirst for human blood
and torture. O reason, where art thou fled! O humanity, where hast thou
hidden thyself? Patriots of '76, has your blood been spilt in vain,
that in 1843 the Executive of a great Republican State can coolly say,
"I have not yet read them, and probably never will?" Is liberty only a
name? Is protection of person and property fled from free America? _Let
those answer who can_.

[Sidenote: A Sudden Illness of the Prophet.]

_Friday, 15.--_I awoke this morning in good health, but was soon
suddenly seized with a great dryness of the mouth and throat, sickness
of the stomach, and vomited freely. My wife waited on me, assisted by
my scribe, Dr. Willard Richards, and his brother Levi, who administered
to me herbs and mild {116} drinks. I was never prostrated so low, in so
short a time, before; but by evening was considerably revived.

Very warm for the season.

_Saturday, 16.--_This morning I felt considerably better; arose at 10,
and sat all day in the City Council, which was held in my house for my
accommodation.

[Sidenote: Comment on Appeal to the General Government for Protection.]

The Mayor, Aldermen, and Councilors signed officially the Memorial
to Congress for redress of losses and grievances in Missouri. While
discussing the petition to Congress, I prophesied, by virtue of the
holy Priesthood vested in me, and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
that, if Congress will not hear our petition and grant us protection,
they shall be broken up as a government. [4] * * *

I informed the Council that it was my wish they should ask the
privilege of calling on Government for the United States troops to
protect us in our privileges, which is not unconstitutional, but lies
in the breast of Congress.

Heber C. Kimball was duly elected city auctioneer, in place of Charles
Warner, removed.

The Council passed "An ordinance regulating merchants and grocers;"
also "An ordinance concerning the landing of steamers;" and Jonathan
Dunham was appointed wharf-master for one year.

{117} Heber C. Kimball and George A. Smith were appointed a committee
to wait on Mr. Davidson Hibbard, and solicit from him a block of land,
whereon to erect a city prison.

After Council, conversed with some of the Twelve, brother Turley and
others, till 8 p.m. Prayer meeting in the evening.

Warm, foggy, and muddy day.

_Sunday, 17.--_At home till 4 p.m.; attended prayer meeting at the
assembly room. Samuel Harrison Smith admitted. Returned home at 7.

River clear of ice as far up as the Stone Tavern.

Mr. King Follet, one of the constables of Hancock County, started with
ten men this afternoon to arrest John Elliott for kidnapping Daniel
Avery, upon a warrant granted by Aaron Johnson, Esq., J. P.

_Monday, 18.--_After dinner, Constable Follet returned with John
Elliott, a schoolmaster, when an examination was had before Esq.
Johnson, in the assembly room. Elliott was found guilty of kidnapping
Avery, and bound over in the sum of $3,000 to the Circuit court of
Carthage for trial. I endeavored to have the court reduce those bonds,
as Mr. Elliott was comparatively a stranger in Nauvoo; but did not
succeed.

During the investigation, testimony appeared to show that Elliott had
threatened my life; and for this I made affidavit and brought him to
trial before Robert D. Foster, J. P., immediately after he had been
bound over by Esq. Johnson. I extract from the proceedings, in part,
from the _Neighbor_:--

    THE TRIAL OF JOHN ELLIOTT.

    The prisoner was brought forward, and the court said it was his
    privilege to plead for a change of venue, by paying the costs; but
    as the costs were not forthcoming, the court proceeded.

    Mr. Styles then read the "Act to regulate the apprehension of
    offenders and for other purposes," p 219, r. s. The act sets forth
    that the use of threatening language is sufficient to criminate
    individuals. This we are prepared to prove.

    {118} Sisson Chase sworn.

    The testimony was similar to that before delivered, [in Chase
    affidavit see p. 109] with the following additional items:--

    I did ask him if he had authority. In the morning he said that he
    would not care about shooting some of the Mormons. In conversation
    with him, he carried the idea that a conspiracy was formed against
    Joseph Smith and others, and that some of them would be shot. These
    conversations were had at different times. He thought Mr. Smith was
    a bad character. He thought they ought to be taken. Question: Who?
    Joseph Smith and some others.

    I told him he had been taken, but had been acquitted. He did not
    thank the Governor for that. He carried the idea that there was a
    conspiracy against his life, and said we have a plan in operation
    that will pop him over.

    Mr. Elliott sworn.

    By the Court: Is your residence, Mr. Elliott, in this county? Yes.

    Messrs. Marr and Styles, attorneys, resident in Nauvoo, made some
    thrilling remarks pertaining to the outrageous proceedings of
    Missouri. The diabolical conduct of those wretches who could be
    engaged in destroying and kidnapping their fellowmen was portrayed
    in glowing colors.

    Judge Phelps and General Smith then followed on the same subject:
    their language was thrillingly eloquent and powerful. If ever
    inhumanity and deeds of blood were depicted in their true colors,
    it was on that occasion: their thoughts flashed as fire, and they
    spake in "words that burned." We never saw the character of General
    Smith so clearly developed; for while he abhorred and depicted the
    fiendish crime that the culprit stood charged with in its true
    colors, he pitied the poor wretch that then stood before him, and
    with feelings of commiseration, benevolence, and philanthropy,
    withdrew his charge--wished, if it was within the power of the
    court, that the culprit might be forgiven,--promised to pay all the
    charges, and invited him and those of his friends who came along
    with him, to come to his house, and they should be taken care of.
    It would be superfluous for us to attempt to give even a faint
    outline of the remarks made by the above-named gentlemen. We hope
    to have at least a synopsis of their speeches for publication,
    which we are sure would be highly interesting to our readers. Upon
    the whole, although a painful, yet it was an interesting occasion
    and will long be remembered; and unless Mr. Elliott's heart and
    those of his friends were made of adamant, it must have made an
    indelible impression on their minds, and almost made them hate
    themselves.

I received from Aaron Johnson, Esq., the following demand:--

    {119} _Legion Aid Applied For_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, December 18, 1843.

    SIR:--I have been informed that a writ issued by me for the body of
    Levi Williams, for kidnapping Daniel Avery, will be resisted by an
    armed force: Therefore, according to the provision of the Charter,
    I wish you to order me a detachment of the Nauvoo Legion--say 100
    men, to enforce the law of the State, and bring the said Williams
    to justice.

    AARON JOHNSON, J. P.

Which demand I complied with by writing to Major-General Wilson Law.

    _Detachment of the Legion Ordered into Service_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, Dec. 18, 1843.

    SIR:--You will detach 100 men, under the direction of Aaron
    Johnson, a Justice of the Peace, for the purpose of assisting
    the constable in executing the law of the State in taking Levi
    Williams, who is charged with kidnapping Daniel Avery.

    Yours,

    JOSEPH SMITH, Lieut-Gen., N. L.

    Commanding Nauvoo Legion.

Gen. Wilson detached Colonel Stephen Markham with 100 men for that
purpose.

[Sidenote: Rumors of Mob Risings.]

About 10 p.m., two young men arrived as express, stating that a mob
was collecting at Warsaw, also at Colonel Levi Williams' house; and
messengers had gone to the mob in Missouri to reinforce their number
there.

    Personally appeared Willard Richards before me, Joseph Smith,
    Mayor of said city, and upon his oath deposeth and saith that from
    information he has received, he verily believes that the peace of
    said city is in danger from a mobocratic assemblage at Warsaw, and
    a force collected under the command of Colonel Levi Williams in the
    lower part of the county, and runners having been sent to Missouri
    to excite the Missourians to join the mobbers in this county, for
    the purpose of making {120} a descent on said city, or disturbing
    its peaceable inhabitants; and further your deponent saith not.

    _Legion Ordered into Service_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, Dec. 18, 1843.

    SIR:--I am credibly informed that a warlike force is collecting at
    or near Warsaw, for the purpose of some violent move towards this
    city or some of the inhabitants thereof. You will therefore order
    out such a portion of the Nauvoo Legion as may be necessary to
    repel any such mobocratic or hostile design of the same unlawful
    force, and also as may be sufficient to secure the peace of the
    citizens, according to law.

    Yours,

    JOSEPH SMITH, Lieut-Gen. N. L.

    MAJOR-GEN. WILSON LAW,

    Commanding Nauvoo Legion.

I returned home to rest about one o'clock in the morning of the 19th.

[Sidenote: Moves and Counter Moves of Forces.]

_Tuesday, 19.--_At home. About 9 a.m., a part of the company who went
with Hosea Stout returned, and stated that they went within two miles
of Colonel Williams', when they were informed that a body of men, armed
with rifles, &c., were collected at his house, and he judged it prudent
to return for weapons and help; also that Brother Chester Loveland told
them that he had seen thirty armed men following Constable King Follett
some miles on his way, when he had Elliott in custody.

Esq. Johnson immediately wrote to Loveland to have him come to Nauvoo
and make affidavit of the warlike movements of the mob, that he might
send to the Governor.

I directed my clerks to make copies of the affidavits respecting the
kidnapping of the Averys to send to Governor Ford, that he might be
left without excuse, although he may probably not read them.

{121} Elder William Martindale writes from Washington, Wayne county,
Iowa:--

    STRANGE CELESTIAL PHENOMENON--1860.

    A singular phenomenon was seen in this neighborhood. Jesse
    Fox, William and Lorenzo Fox, David Bale, James Wilson, and
    William Cole, with some others, retired to the house of Solomon
    Mendenhall, at which place they stayed a short time. While there
    they discovered a ball rising from the east in an oblique line;
    and as it ascended it moved towards the west with great rapidity
    until it was high in the heavens, leaving a streak of light behind
    it, which to the natural eye, had the appearance of being thirty
    or forty feet in length. This light remained stationary for about
    one minute. Both ends then coming round, formed a figure 8, which
    figure also retained its position for the same space of time. It
    then was transformed into a figure 6, which also remained for about
    a minute. It then was formed into a cipher or 0, which remained for
    about three minutes. The figures put together made 1860 in large
    figures in the heavens. The phenomenon was indeed singular, and has
    been a matter of great speculation with us.

[Sidenote: Legion Parade]

At one p.m. I was present when the Legion paraded near the Temple, were
inspected by the officers, and instructed to prepare themselves with
arms and ammunition and to hold themselves in readiness, for a moment's

    Joseph Smith, Mayor of said city; and after being duly sworn,
    deposeth and saith that on the 18th day of December, 1843, he was
    about four miles below Warsaw, in Hancock County, shortly after the
    constable arrested John Elliott for being concerned in kidnapping
    Daniel Avery, not long since, and saw the men of the neighborhood
    gathering with arms to retake the said John Elliott; and when
    asked what they would do, if the Governor did not sanction such an
    unlawful course, several of them replied, "Damn the Governor! If he
    opens his head, we will punch a hole through him! He dare not open
    his head! We will serve him the same sauce we will the Mormons."
    The said {122} mob then went to Warsaw, where your affiant saw them
    with their arms; and further your affiant saith not.

    On the 20th day of December, 1843, personally appeared before
    me, Willard Richards, clerk of the Municipal Court of said city
    Philander Avery, of Bear Creek precinct, in said county, and after
    being duly sworn, deposeth and saith that on the 19th day of
    November, 1843, at his house, in the precinct aforesaid, Ebenezer
    Richardson, of Lee county, Territory of Iowa, by false pretenses,
    persuaded your affiant to accompany said Richardson to the
    Mississippi river at Warsaw, where your affiant was seized by one
    Joseph C. McCoy, of Clark county, Missouri, in connection with the
    said Richardson, and about one dozen of other individuals, whose
    names are unknown to your affiant, and by them forced across said
    Mississippi River, where they bound your affiant; and Mark Childs
    swore that your affiant had stolen said McCoy's horse and colt, and
    that his father Daniel Avery had secreted said horse and colt, and
    said Richardson threatened your affiant with death or seven years'
    imprisonment, in order to persuade him to make false statements,
    and testify that his father, Daniel Avery, had stolen said McCoy's
    horse and colt, which statements your affiant made, and swore
    to the same, while in duress, with a bowie-knife presented to
    intimidate. And your affiant further saith that the testimony he
    gave concerning his father's guilt, was extorted from him through
    fear, while in duress, and said testimony was absolutely false,
    and your affiant fully believed that his father is innocent of the
    crime of stealing said McCoy's horse and colt; and further your
    deponent saith not.

    Aaron Johnson, a Justice of the Peace in and for said county,

    in said county, and, after being duly sworn, depose and say that
    on the evening of the 2nd day of December, 1843, at Vernon Doty's
    mill, in said precinct, Colonel Levi Williams, of said Hancock
    county, as principal, and his son, John Williams, with William
    Middleton, of the county of Clark and State of Missouri, Captain
    McCoy, of the said county of Clark and State of Missouri, John Fox
    of Green Plains precinct, and about a dozen other men, armed with
    pistols, dirks and bowie knives came forcibly upon Daniel Avery at
    said Doty's mill, and seized and bound him. The said Avery told
    them to stand off. They said they had a writ. He observed, he would
    not resist legal authority. They said they would take said Avery to
    Warsaw, and there to try him. The said Avery replied, "I understand
    you: you will take me to Warsaw, and there pass me over the river
    to Missouri." Some of said gang then shouted, "Lay hold of him;
    G--d d--n him, lay hold of him: there's no use of parleying;" at
    which Colonel Levi Williams, with a large bowie-knife in his hand,
    and others, then forced the said Daniel Avery to submit, telling
    him (without a writ,) that his life would be taken if he did not
    submit. They then tied him with silk handkerchiefs. Colonel Levi
    Williams and another person then led the said Daniel Avery away;
    and as they passed your affiants within the distance of about four
    rods, the said Daniel Avery cried out to one of your said affiants,
    "tell my friends where I am gone." Colonel Williams told said Avery
    to hold his peace, for it was of no use. William Middleton then got
    a horse; and after tying him upon said horse, as sworn to before by
    another witness, they then conveyed him to Missouri without an by
    another witness, they then conveyed him to Missouri without a writ
    or trial, as your affiants verily believe; and further they say not.

4. This prediction doubtless has reference to the party in power;
to the "government" considered as the administration; not to the
"government" considered as the country; but the administration party,
the Democratic Party, which had controlled the destiny of the country
for forty years. It is matter of history that few years later the party
then in power lost control of the national government, followed by the
terrible conflict of the Civil War. The Party against which the above
prediction was made so far lost its influence that it did not again
return to power for a quarter of a century; and when it did return to
power it was with such modified views as to many great questions of
government, that it could scarcely be regarded as the same party except
in name.

Lest it should be urged that the Whig party was in control of the
government in 1843, I call attention to the fact that while General
Harrison, a Whig, was elected in 1840, he was President only one month,
as he died on the 4th of April, 1841. His whole cabinet, excepting Mr.
Webster, Secretary of State, resigned, and the Vice President became
President. Though elected by the Whigs Mr. Tyler was a Democrat "and
the Whig administration had but a month's actual existence." (See
History of the United States, Morris, pp. 311, 312).

RETURN TO NAUVOO--RECITAL OF HIS ADVENTURES--AVERY'S ACQUITTAL BY
MISSOURI'S COURTS--NAUVOO'S POLICE FORCE INCREASED--PUBLICATIONS ON
MORMONISM, PRO ET CON--1843.

_Thursday, December 21, 1843.--_About one o'clock in the morning I was
alarmed by the firing of a gun, got up, and went down to the river
bank to see the guard, and inquire the cause of it. To my surprise,
they had not heard it, although I felt sure it was fired in Montrose.
The morning proved it to be correct, some rowdies in Montrose had been
firing in the night.

At noon met with the City Council which voted that Councilor Orson
Pratt present the Memorial and Ordinance to Congress.

Passed "An ordinance to prevent unlawful search or seizure of person or
property by foreign [i.e. outside] process in the city of Nauvoo."

Heber C. Kimball resigned his office as city auctioneer and Charles
Warner was re-elected.

John P. Greene was duly elected city marshal, in the room of Henry G.
Sherwood, who expects to leave soon.

[Sidenote: The Prophet for a Clean, Orderly City.]

I gave instructions to the marshal and policemen to see that all
carrion is removed out of the city, and all houses kept in order,--to
stop the boys when fighting in the streets, and prevent children from
floating off on the ice, and correct anything out of order, like
fathers; and I offered to build the city jail, if it was left to my
dictation, which the Council authorized me to do.

{125} I insert the Memorial from the City Council to the Congress of
the United States for redress of grievances and protection from further
persecution, which was signed by them:--

    MEMORIAL OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO CONGRESS.

    _"To the Honorable Senators and Representatives of the United
    States of America in Congress assembled_,

    We, the undersigned members of the City Council of the City of
    Nauvoo, citizens of Hancock County, Illinois, and exiles from
    the State of Missouri, being in council assembled, unanimously
    and respectfully, for ourselves, and in behalf of many thousands
    of other exiles, memorialize the honorable Senators and
    Representatives of our nation upon the subject of the unparalleled
    persecutions and cruelties inflicted upon us and upon our
    constituents by the constituted authorities of the State of
    Missouri, and likewise upon the subject of the present unfortunate
    circumstances in which we are placed in the land of our exile. As
    a history of the Missouri outrages has been extensively published,
    both in this country and in Europe, it is deemed unnecessary to
    particularize all of the wrongs and grievances inflicted upon us in
    this memorial. As there is an abundance of well-attested documents
    to which your honorable body can at any time refer, hence we only
    embody the following important items for your consideration.

    First:--Your memorialists, as freeborn citizens of this great
    republic, relying with the utmost confidence upon the sacred
    "articles of the Constitution," by which the several States are
    bound together, and considering ourselves entitled to all the
    privileges and immunities of free citizens in what State soever we
    desired to locate ourselves, commenced a settlement in the county
    of Jackson, on the western frontiers of the State of Missouri, in
    the summer of 1831.

    There we purchased lands from the Government, erected several
    hundred houses, made extensive improvements, and shortly the wild
    and lonely prairies and stately forests were converted into well
    cultivated and fruitful fields. There we expected to spend our days
    in the enjoyment of all the rights and liberties bequeathed to us
    by the sufferings and blood of our noble ancestors. But alas! our
    expectations were vain.

    Two years had scarcely elapsed before we were unlawfully and
    unconstitutionally assaulted by an organized mob, consisting of the
    highest officers in the county, both civil and military, who openly
    and boldly avowed their determination in a written circular to
    drive us from said county.

    As a specimen of their treasonable and cruel designs, your
    honorable {126} body are referred to said circular, of which the
    following is but a short extract,--namely: "We the undersigned
    citizens of Jackson county, believing that an important crisis
    is at hand, as regards our civil society, in consequence of a
    pretended religious sect of people that have settled and are still
    settling in our county, styling themselves Mormons, and intending
    as we do to rid our society, 'peaceably if we can, forcibly if
    we must;' and believing as we do that the arm of the civil law
    does not afford us a guarantee, or at least a sufficient one,
    against the evils which are now inflicted upon us, and seem to be
    increasing by the said religious sect, deem it expedient and of the
    highest importance to form ourselves into a company for the better
    and easier accomplishment of our purpose."

    This document was closed in the following words--"We therefore
    agree that, after timely warning, and receiving an adequate
    compensation for what little property they cannot take with them,
    they refuse to leave us in peace, as they found us, we agree to use
    such means as may be sufficient to remove them; and to that end we
    each pledge to each other our bodily powers, our lives, fortunes,
    and sacred honors."

    To this unconstitutional document were attached the names of nearly
    every officer in the county, together with the names of hundreds of
    others.

    It was by this band of murderers that your memorialists, in the
    year 1833, were plundered of their property and robbed of their
    peaceable homes. It was by them that their fields were laid waste,
    their houses burned, and their men, women, and children, to the
    number of about twelve hundred persons, banished as exiles from the
    county, while others were cruelly murdered by their hands.

    Second: After our expulsion from Jackson county, we settled in
    Clay county, on the opposite side of the Missouri river, where we
    purchased lands both from the old settlers and from the [U. S.]
    Land Office: but soon we were again violently threatened by mobs,
    and obliged to leave our homes, and seek out a new location.

    Third: Our next settlement was in Caldwell county, where we
    purchased the most of the land in said county, beside a part of the
    lands in Daviess and Carroll counties. These counties were almost
    entirely in a wild and uncultivated state; but, by the persevering
    industry of our citizens, large and extensive farms were opened in
    every direction, well stocked with numerous flocks and herds. We
    also commenced settlements in several other counties of the state,
    and once more confidently hoped to enjoy the hard-earned fruits of
    our labor unmolested.

    But our hopes were soon blasted. The cruel and murderous spirit
    which first began to manifest itself in the constituted authorities
    and inhabitants of Jackson county, and afterwards in Clay and the
    surrounding {127} counties, receiving no check either from the
    civil or military power of the state, had in the meantime taken
    courage, and boldly and fearlessly spread its contaminating and
    treasonable influence into every department of the government
    of said state. Lieutenant-Governor Boggs, a resident of Jackson
    county, who acted a conspicuous part in our expulsion from said
    county, instead of being tried for treason and rebellion against
    the Constitution, and suffering the just penalty of his crimes, was
    actually elected governor; and placed in the executive chair.

    Thus the inhabitants of the State were greatly encouraged to renew
    with redoubled fury, their unlawful attacks upon our defenseless
    settlements. Men, women, and children were driven away in every
    direction before their merciless persecutors, robbed of their
    possessions, their property, their provisions, and their all, cast
    forth upon the bleak, snowy prairies, houseless and unprotected.
    Many sank down and expired under their accumulated sufferings,
    while others, after enduring hunger and the severities of the
    season, suffering all but death, arrived in Caldwell county, to
    which place they were driven from all the surrounding counties,
    only to witness a still more heart-rending scene.

    In vain had we appealed to the constituted authorities of Missouri
    for protection and redress of our former grievances. In vain we
    now stretched out our hands and appealed as the citizens of this
    great republic to the sympathies, to the justice, and magnanimity
    of those in power. In vain we implored again and again at the feet
    of Governor Boggs, our former persecutor, for aid and protection
    against the ravages and murders now inflicted upon our defenseless
    and unoffending citizens. The cry of American citizens, already
    twice driven and deprived of liberty, could not penetrate their
    adamantine hearts.

    The Governor, instead of sending us aid, issued a proclamation for
    our extermination and banishment, ordered out the forces of the
    State, placed them under the command of General Clark, who, to
    execute these exterminating orders, marched several thousand troops
    into our settlements in Caldwell county, where, unrestrained by
    fear of law or justice, and urged on by the highest authority of
    the state, they laid waste our fields of corn, shot down our cattle
    and hogs for sport, burned our dwellings, inhumanly butchered
    some eighteen or twenty defenseless citizens, dragged from their
    hiding-places little children, and placing the muzzles of their
    guns to their heads, shot them [such acts being accompanied] with
    the most horrid oaths and imprecations.

    An aged hero and patriot of the Revolution, who served under
    General Washington, while in the act of pleading for quarter, was
    cruelly murdered and hewed in pieces with an old corn cutter;
    and in addition to all these savage acts of barbarity, they
    forcibly dragged virtuous and {128} inoffensive females from their
    dwellings, bound them upon benches used for public worship, where
    they in great numbers ravished them in the most brutal manner.

    Some fifty or sixty of the citizens were thrust into prisons and
    dungeons, where, bound in chains, they were fed on human flesh,
    while their families and some fifteen thousand others were at the
    point of the bayonet, forcibly expelled from the State.

    In the meantime, to pay the expenses of these horrid outrages, they
    confiscated our property, and robbed us of all our possessions.

    Before our final expulsion, with a faint and lingering hope we
    petitioned the State legislature then in session, unwilling to
    believe that the virtue and patriotism of the venerable fathers
    of the Revolution had fled from the bosoms of their illustrious
    descendants--unwilling to believe that American citizens could
    appeal in vain for a restoration of liberty cruelly wrested from
    them by cruel tyrants. But in the language of our noble ancestors,
    "our repeated petitions were only answered by repeated injuries."

    The legislature, instead of hearing the cries of 15,000
    suffering, bleeding, unoffending citizens, sanctioned and sealed
    the unconstitutional acts of the governor and his troops,
    by appropriating 200,000 dollars to defray the expenses of
    exterminating us from the State. No friendly arm was stretched out
    to protect us. The last ray of hope for redress in that State was
    now entirely extinguished. We saw no other alternative but to bow
    down our necks and wear the cruel yoke of oppression, and quietly
    and submissively suffer ourselves to be banished as exiles from our
    possessions, our property, and our sacred homes, or otherwise see
    our wives and children coldly butchered and murdered by tyrants in
    power.

    Fourth. Our next permanent settlement was in the land of our
    exile, the State of Illinois, in the spring of 1839; but even here
    we are not secure from our relentless persecutor, the State of
    Missouri. Not satisfied in having drenched her soil in the blood
    of innocence, and expelling us from her borders, she pursues her
    unfortunate victims into banishment, seizing upon and kidnapping
    them in their defenseless moments, dragging them across the
    Mississippi river, upon their inhospitable shores, there they are
    tortured, whipped, immured in dungeons, and finally hung [as a
    means of torture, but not unto death] by the neck without any legal
    process what ever.

    We have memorialized the former Executive of this State, Governor
    Carlin, upon these lawless outrages committed upon our citizens;
    but he rendered us no protection. Missouri, receiving no check in
    her murderous career, continues her depredations, again and again
    kidnapping {129} our citizens and robbing us of our property;
    while others, who fortunately survived the execution of her bloody
    edicts, are again and again demanded by the Executive of that
    State, on pretense of some crime said to have been committed by
    them during the exterminating expedition against our people.

    As an instance, General Joseph Smith, one of your memorialists,
    has been three times demanded, tried, and acquitted by the courts
    of this State, upon investigation under writs of _habeas corpus_,
    once by the United States Court for the District of Illinois, again
    by the Circuit Court of the State of Illinois, and lastly by the
    Municipal Court of the City of Nauvoo, when at the same time a
    _nolle prosequi_ had been entered by the courts of Missouri upon
    all the cases of that State against Joseph Smith and others.

    Thus the said Joseph Smith has been several times tried for the
    same alleged offense, put in jeopardy of life and limb, contrary
    to the fifth article of the amendments to the Constitution of the
    United States; and thus we have been continually harassed and
    robbed of our money to defray the expenses of these vexatious
    prosecutions. And what at the present time seems to be still more
    alarming, is the hostility manifested by some of the authorities
    and citizens of this State [Illinois.] Conventions have been
    called, inflammatory speeches made, and many unlawful and
    unconstitutional resolutions adopted to deprive us of our rights,
    our liberties, and the peaceable enjoyment of our possessions.

    From the present hostile aspect, and from bitter experience in
    the State of Missouri, it is greatly feared lest the barbarous
    scenes acted in that State will be re-acted in this. If Missouri
    goes unpunished, others will be greatly encouraged to follow her
    murderous examples.

    The afflictions of your memorialists have already been
    overwhelming--too much for humanity, too much for American citizens
    to endure without complaint. We have groaned under the iron hand
    of tyranny and oppression these many years. We have been robbed of
    our property to the amount of two millions of dollars. We have been
    hunted as wild beasts of the forest. We have seen our aged fathers
    who fought in the Revolution and our innocent children alike
    slaughtered by our persecutors; we have seen the fair daughters
    of American citizens insulted and abused in the most inhuman
    manner; and finally we have seen fifteen thousand souls--men, women
    and children, driven by force of arms during the severities of
    the winter from their sacred homes and firesides, penniless and
    unprotected, to a land of strangers.

    Under all these afflicting circumstances, we imploringly stretch
    forth {130} our hands towards the highest councils of our nation,
    and humbly appeal to the illustrious Senators and Representatives
    of a great and free people for redress and protection.

    Hear, O hear the petitioning voice of many thousands of American
    citizens, who now groan in exile on Columbia's free soil! Hear, O
    hear the weeping and bitter lamentations of widows and orphans,
    whose husbands and fathers have been cruelly martyred in the land
    where the proud eagle exulting soars! Let it not be recorded in the
    archives of the nations that Columbia's exiles sought protection
    and redress at your hands, but sought it in vain. It is in your
    power to save us, our wives, and our children from a repetition
    of the bloodthirsty scenes of Missouri, and greatly relieve the
    fears of a persecuted and injured people, by ordaining for their
    protection the following ordinance, namely--

    AN ORDINANCE

    _For the protection of the people styled the Church of Jesus Christ
    of Latter-day Saints, residing on the western borders of the State
    of Illinois._

    PREAMBLE.

    Whereas the State of Missouri at sundry times has
    unconstitutionally deprived a certain portion of her citizens
    (called "Mormons,") of their rights, property, lands, and even of
    their lives:

    And whereas, in the years 1838 and 1839 the said State of Missouri
    with impunity did illegally and inhumanly exile and banish for ever
    from her limits and jurisdiction all the said citizens (called
    "Mormons,") that remained alive.

    And whereas, after being hospitably received by the citizens of
    Illinois, the said State of Illinois did grant, enact, and charter
    for the benefit and convenience of the said exiled "Mormons" as
    follows:--

[Here in the original document is inserted the city charter of Nauvoo
already published, Vol. IV, pp 239-249.]

    And whereas, by the 10th article of the Constitution of the
    United States as amended--"Art. 10. The powers not delegated to
    the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to
    the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the
    people;" and whereas, according to the fourth article and section
    second, "The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all
    privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States:" and
    whereas, according to the second paragraph of the {131} third
    section of said Constitution, "The Congress shall have power to
    dispose of and make the needful rules and regulations respecting
    territory;" and whereas the said Congress has the power to protect
    each state against invasion and insurrection: and whereas most of
    the inhabitants of the city of Nauvoo are exiles from the State
    of Missouri: and whereas most of the lands owned in the State of
    Missouri were purchased from the United States, and patented by
    the United States to the amount of more than $200,000 worth: and
    whereas the United States are bound to clear the title and protect
    it: and whereas the said exiles or expelled "Mormons" have lost in
    property and damages about two millions of dollars: and whereas the
    said State of Missouri continues her ravages, persecutions, and
    plunderings, by kidnapping said exiles from Illinois, and by other
    depredations:

    Now, therefore, to show the fatherly care of the United States,
    to ratify the said charter, to protect the said exiles from mob
    violence, and shield them in their rights:--

    Section 1. Be it ordained by the Senate and House of
    Representatives of the United States of America in Congress
    assembled, that all the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities
    belonging to Territories, and not repugnant to the Constitution
    of the United States, are hereby granted and secured to the
    inhabitants of the city of Nauvoo, in addition to the spirit,
    letter, meaning, and provisions of the afore-mentioned charter, or
    act of incorporation from the State of Illinois, until the State
    of Missouri restores to those exiled citizens the lands, rights,
    privileges, property, and damage for all losses.

    Section 2. And be it further ordained, in order to effect the
    object and further intention of this ordinance, and for the peace,
    security, happiness, convenience, benefit, and prosperity of the
    said city of Nauvoo, and for the common weal and honor of our
    country, that the mayor of Nauvoo be, and he is hereby empowered by
    this consent of the President of the United States; whenever the
    actual necessity of the case and the public safety shall require
    it, to call to his aid a sufficient number of United States forces,
    in connection with the Nauvoo Legion, to repel the invasion of
    mobs, keep the public peace, and protect the innocent from the
    unhallowed ravages of lawless banditti that escape justice on the
    western frontier; and also to preserve the power and dignity of the
    Union.

    Section 3. And be it further ordained that the officers of the
    United States army are hereby required to obey the requisitions of
    this ordinance.

    Section 4. And be it further ordained that, for all services
    rendered in quelling mobs and preserving the public peace the said
    Nauvoo {132} Legion shall be under the same regulations, rules, and
    laws of pay as the troops of the United States.

Two letters came into the post-office from the sheriff of Clark County,
Missouri. From them it appears that that State wishes to continue the
old game of seizing witnesses and making prisoners of them, to cover up
her mobocracy and kidnapping under a legal form. The following answer
was written:--

    _Letter: W. W. Phelps to J. White, Esq., Anent Avery Affair_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, ILL., Dec. 21, 1843.

    SIR,--Two letters were put into my hands this morning relative
    to the witnesses of Mr. Avery's innocence as to being accessory
    to horse stealing some four years since. In the first place, Mr.
    Avery was abducted from this State without process, contrary to
    law. In the second place, the principal for felony by the law of
    Missouri should be indicted within three years, &c. Again, the
    revised statutes of Missouri have a wise provision in such cases
    as Mr. Avery's. If Mr. Avery, therefore, will sue out a commission
    according to the law concerning {133} depositions, (R. S., page 219
    to 222,) directed to Alderman Geo. W. Harris, an acting justice
    of the peace for the city of Nauvoo, and county of Hancock, the
    necessary testimony to establish Mr. Avery's innocence will be
    taken according to law, and forwarded to the proper officer in due
    time.

    Respectfully, &c..

    W. W. PHELPS.

    J. WHITE, ESQ., Dep. Sheriff,

    Clark Co., Waterloo, Mo.

    P.S. You will have the politeness to show this to Mr. Avery.

In the evening I was visited by several strangers, and had considerable
conversation with them.

_Friday, 22.--_At home at nine o'clock, a.m., reading a magazine to my
children.

[Sidenote: Attitude of Prophet on Mobocracy and Politics.]

A little after twelve went into the store-room occupied by Butler
and Lewis, and commenced a conversation with Dr. John F. Charles, to
convince him that mobocracy is not justifiable, and that I did not deal
in politics.

David Holman, living about two miles from Ramus, went out in the
evening with his family visiting. About ten o'clock he discovered his
house on fire. The neighbors had inquired how long he would be gone.
A man rode to Carthage. A company went up, secured the provisions to
themselves, and fired the house.

Warm and pleasant weather.

_Saturday, 23.--_At home, counseling the brethren who called on me, and
attending to my domestic duties, making preparations for a Christmas
dinner party.

Prayer meeting in the Assembly Room.

_Sunday, 24.--_At home. Received a visit from Mr. Richardson, one of
the men who assisted in kidnapping Avery. He manifested some repentance
and sorrow for his part in that transaction, and promised to use what
influence he had with the Missourians to have Avery set at liberty.

[Sidenote: A Christmas Serenade.]

{134} _Monday, 25.--_This morning, about one o'clock, I was aroused by
an English sister, Lettice Rushton, widow of Richard Rushton, Senior,
(who, ten years ago, lost her sight,) accompanied by three of her sons,
with their wives, and her two daughters, with their husbands, and
several of her neighbors, singing, "Mortals, awake! with angels join,"
&c., which caused a thrill of pleasure to run through my soul. All of
my family and boarders arose to hear the serenade, and I felt to thank
my Heavenly Father for their visit, and blessed them in the name of the
Lord. They also visited my brother Hyrum, who was awakened from his
sleep. He arose and went out of doors. He shook hands with and blessed
each one of them in the name of the Lord, and said that he thought
at first that a cohort of angels had come to visit him, it was such
heavenly music to him.

At home all day. About noon, gave counsel to some brethren who called
on me from Morley Settlement, and told them to keep law on their side,
and they would come out well enough.

At two o'clock, about fifty couples sat down at my table to dine. While
I was eating, my scribe called, requesting me to solemnize the marriage
of his brother, Dr. Levi Richards, and Sara Griffiths; but as I could
not leave, I referred him to President Brigham Young, who married them.

[Sidenote: Rockwell's Return to Nauvoo.]

A large party supped at my house, and spent the evening in music,
dancing, &c., in a most cheerful and friendly manner. During the
festivities, a man with his hair long and falling over his shoulders,
and apparently drunk, came in and acted like a Missourian. I requested
the captain of the police to put him out of doors. A scuffle ensued,
and I had an opportunity to look him full in the face, when, to my
great surprise and joy untold, I discovered it was my long-tried,
warm, but cruelly persecuted friend, Orrin {135} Porter Rockwell, just
arrived from nearly a year's imprisonment, without conviction, in
Missouri.

The following is his statement of his experience and sufferings by that
people:--

    _Rockwell's Experience in Missouri_.

    I, Orrin Porter Rockwell, was on my way from New Jersey to Nauvoo;
    and while at St. Louis, on the 4th March, 1843, was arrested
    by a Mr. Fox, on oath of Elias Parker, who swore I was the O.
    P. Rockwell advertised in the papers as having attempted to
    assassinate Lilburn W. Boggs, and was taken before a magistrate in
    St. Louis.

    I was then put into the St. Louis county jail, and kept two days
    with a pair of iron hobbles on my ankles. About midnight, was taken
    into the stage coach in charge of Fox, and started for Jefferson
    City. There were nine passengers, two of them women. I sat on the
    middle seat. One of the men behind me commenced gouging me in the
    back. I spoke to him, and told him that it was dark, and I could
    not see him, but that he was no gentleman. One of the ladies
    whispered to him, and he ceased the operation.

    The next night, the driver, being drunk, ran against a tree, and
    broke the king bolt; and not knowing what to do, ironed as I was,
    I crawled into the boot, and found an extra bolt, and in the dark
    fixed the coach, got it off the tree, and we started on. Soon
    after, ran against a bank, and could not move. I was asleep at the
    time, but the bustle awake me, when I told them, if they would
    take off my irons, I would get off and drive, as the driver was
    too drunk to manage the horses. They refused. I, however, got hold
    of the lines, and, by the help of other passengers lifting at the
    wheels, got it righted, and I drove to the next stand, near the
    Osage river. The roads were very bad, and the load heavy; so we got
    along slowly.

    There was an officer of the U. S. army in the coach. We were two
    days and two nights from St. Louis in reaching Jefferson City,
    where I was lodged in the jail two days and two nights. The U. S.
    officer went on.

    Started on for Independence, still in charge of Fox. At Boonville,
    overtook the U.S. officer. We three were all that were in the coach
    all the way from Boonville to Independence. Sheriff Reynolds told
    me afterwards that when he looked into the stage he took me for the
    guard, and the officer for the prisoner, for he looked like the
    guilty one.

    Was about four days going to Independence: arrived there just at
    night. A large crowd gathered around, making many remarks. Some
    {136} were for hanging me at once. I was then placed in the jail.
    In two or three days, underwent a sham trial before a justice of
    the peace. The courthouse was crowded, and the men were armed with
    hickory clubs. They set on boys from ten to twelve years of age to
    kick and punch me, which they did repeatedly. While in court, Fox
    was the main witness introduced, and he swore falsely.

    Fox swore that I had stated to him that I had not been in the
    county for five years. I informed the court that Fox swore falsely,
    in proof thereof that the people of Independence knew that I had
    traveled through Independence several times during that time, for
    the people were all well aware of my having visited this place,
    which fact alone should satisfy them that Fox was swearing for
    money, which I afterwards learned that he obtained and divided with
    Parker.

    The magistrate committed me to prison for my safe preservation,
    as he was afraid the people would kill me; but he could find no
    crime against me. This I was told by the officer who conveyed me to
    prison.

    I was re-committed to jail, still wearing the iron hobbles, and
    was kept in the upper part in the day-time, and in the dungeon at
    night, with a little dirty straw for a bed, without any bedding, no
    fire, and very cold weather. For eighteen days I was not free from
    shaking with cold. I then got permission to buy 1 1/2 bushels of
    charcoal, which I put into an old kettle, and kept a little fire.
    When that was gone, I could not obtain any more.

    After I was arrested at St. Louis, I was visited by Joseph Wood, an
    apostate "Mormon," who professed to be a lawyer. He was accompanied
    by Mr. Blanerhasset, who told me that everything I had would be
    taken from me, and proposed to take charge, keep, and return to
    me any property I might have with me. I let him have a pair of
    pistols, a bowie knife, and watch, which he never returned to me.

    After the weather got a little warmer, they furnished me with a few
    old newspapers to read. A family lived at the corner of the jail.
    The women once in a while used to send out a little negro girl
    with a small basket of victuals. She handed up to the grate a big
    Missouri whip-stock, with a piece of twine, which I tied to the
    pole and drew up the basket, and let it down again.

    I made a pin-hook and tied to the twine, and baited with a chunk of
    corn-dodger hard enough to knock a negro down with, and stuck it
    out of the grated window and fished for pukes. When passers-by came
    along, they would stop and gawk at me awhile, and pass on.

    A preacher who had a family of girls lived on the opposite side of
    the street. The girls would watch and laugh at them, and call out
    and ask me if I got any bites. I replied, No, but some glorious
    nibbles.

    {137} Numbers were put into the jail with me at different
    times, and taken out again. One of them, who was charged with a
    fraudulent issue of U. S. Treasury notes, was allowed to have his
    saddle-bags with him They contained some fire-steels, gun-flints,
    and articles of Indian trade. I sawed the irons nearly off with
    one of the fire-steels. He got the negro girl to get him a knife,
    and I finished cutting the fetters with it. He would frequently
    call for a good supper and pay for it, which was allowed him, but
    not allowed me. He was very anxious to escape, and urged me to
    undertake it with him. He ordered a good supper, and he ate very
    heartily. I would not eat, telling him that he could not run if he
    ate so much. Nearly dusk, as the jailer came in to get the dishes,
    we sprang to the door, and I locked him in, and threw the key into
    the garden. In coming down stairs, we met the jailer's wife. I told
    her that her husband was unharmed; I had only locked him up. We had
    a board fence to climb over, which was about twelve feet high. I
    climbed it and ran about twenty rods, when he called me to come and
    help him over, which I did. If I had not, I should have escaped.
    The pure air had so great an effect upon me, that I gave out and
    slacked my pace, The populace of the place came up, and I told them
    to run; they would soon catch him; and that I had given out and
    could not run. They soon returned with him. I fell into the crowd
    and walked back to the jail yard.

    Sheriff J. H. Reynolds laid his hand upon my shoulder, he being the
    first to approach me. Asked where the key was. I told him, In the
    garden.

    Smallwood Nowlin was the first who proposed to hang me on the spot,
    when Reynolds gave me a push towards the crowd, and said, "There he
    is, G--d--n him! Do what you damn please with him." Nowlin's son
    in-law (by marrying one of his mulatto wenches), a Mexican, stepped
    up to me to lay hold of me, when I told him to stand off, or I
    would mash his face. He stepped back.

    I then walked up stairs into the jail. Was followed by Reynolds and
    others, until the room and stairs were full. Reynolds asked me what
    I had cut my irons off with. I went to the saddle-bags and handed
    him the knife and fire-steel. While feeling for them, I got hold of
    a piece of buckskin that had some three or four pounds of bullets
    tied up in it which I intended to use in mashing in the head of any
    one that should attempt to put a rope on my neck. A rope was passed
    along over the heads of the people into the room to a bald-headed
    man. About this time pistols could be heard cocking in every part
    of the room, and bowie-knives were produced as if for fight. In a
    few minutes the room was clear of all but three or four persons.

    {138} I was then put into the dungeon, my feet ironed together,
    my right hand to my left foot, so close that I could not half
    straighten myself. The irons, when put on my wrists, were so small
    that they would hardly go on, and swelled them; but in eighteen
    days I could slip them up and turn them around my arm at the elbow.
    I was fed on cold corndodger and meat of the poorest description;
    and if I did not eat it all up, it was returned the next time.

    About a month after the court sat, my irons were taken off, and I
    was so weak that I had to be led to the court-room by the officer.
    I was notified that a bill was found against me for breaking jail,
    and that the grand jury had failed to find a bill against me on the
    charge of shooting Boggs, as charged in the advertisement offering
    a reward for my apprehension.

    I was taken into court, and was asked by the judge if I had any
    counsel. I told him I had not. He asked if I had any means to
    employ a counsel. I answered that I had none with me that I could
    control. He then said, Here are a number of counselors: if I was
    acquainted with any of them, I could take my choice. I told him I
    would make choice of Mr. Doniphan, who arose and made a speech,
    saying he was crowded with business, but that here are plenty of
    young lawyers who could plead for me as well as he could. The
    judge heard his plea, and then told me he did not consider that a
    sufficient excuse, and I could consider Mr. Doniphan my counsel.

    I was then ordered back to jail, and ironed again in the same way.
    Mr. Doniphan asked for and obtained a change of venue to Clay
    County, which is in another district.

    When the officers came to Independence jail for me, they requested
    me to get ready in a hurry, as they feared the mob would kill me. I
    told them I wanted to put on a clean shirt, if it cost me my life,
    as I had not been permitted to enjoy the luxury of a change of
    linen since I had boarded at the expense of Jackson County. While I
    was changing my shirt, the officers several times told me to hurry,
    or the mob would be on me and kill me.

    When I got ready to start, the officers furnished me a very
    hard-trotting horse, with a miserable poor saddle, tied my feet
    under the horse with ropes, and my hands behind my back, and
    started off at a good round trot, in charge of two officers. In a
    short time a strange gentleman fell into our company, who was also
    on horseback. It was six miles to the ferry, where we could cross
    the Missouri river. When we got there, we saw the boat land on
    the opposite side, when several men got off the boat, and took a
    course to the woods, through which the road ran. The boat returned.
    This stranger asked--"Where are {139} those men going?" and was
    answered--"They are going to the woods to hew timber."

    We then crossed, and took our way for Liberty. When we left the
    boat, we saw no signs of people, nor heard any sound of axes.
    After traveling some two or three miles, the woods became dense
    and brushy: we heard the crackling of brush, and the noise of
    men traveling through it. The officers and stranger appeared
    frightened, and urged speed, keeping close watch. We came to an
    opening in the woods, when the noise of crackling of brush ceased.
    We traveled safely to Liberty, where this stranger told his friends
    that he overheard several men in Independence planning to waylay
    me in the thick timber on the Missouri bottom, at the place where
    we heard the noises; but his being in company counteracted their
    plot. I was then lodged in Liberty jail. In a few days afterwards
    I learned that the men who went into the brush told it, that they
    went into the woods according to agreement to waylay me; but when
    they saw this stranger, it frustrated their plans.

    In about ten days, on pretext of informality in the papers, I was
    remanded back to Independence jail. It was rumored that I was again
    going to be waylaid, when the two officers from Clay county took me
    by a different road, and so I escaped the second time.

    When I was put in Independence jail, I was again ironed hand and
    foot, and put in the dungeon, in which condition I remained about
    two months. During this time, Joseph H. Reynolds, the sheriff,
    told me he was going to arrest Joseph Smith, and they had received
    letters from Nauvoo which satisfied them that Joseph Smith had
    unlimited confidence in me, that I was capable of toting him in a
    carriage or on horseback anywhere that I pleased; and if I would
    only tote him out by riding or any other way, so that they could
    apprehend him, I might please myself whether I stayed in Illinois
    or came back to Missouri; they would protect me, and any pile
    that I would name the citizens of Jackson county would donate,
    club together, and raise, and that I should never suffer for want
    afterwards: "you only deliver Joe Smith into our hands, and name
    your pile." I replied--"I will see you all damned first, and then I
    won't."

    About the time that Joseph was arrested by Reynolds at Dixon, I
    knew that they were after him, and [yet had] no means under heaven
    of giving him any information. My anxiety became so intense upon
    the subject, knowing their determination to kill him, that my flesh
    twitched on my bones. I could not help it; twitch it would. While
    undergoing this sensation, I heard a dove alight on the window in
    the upper room of the jail, and commence cooing, and then went
    off. In a short time, he came back to the window, where a pane was
    broken: he crept through between the bars of iron, which were about
    two and-a-half inches apart. {140} I saw it fly round the trap-door
    several times: it did not alight, but continued cooing until it
    crept through the bars again, and flew out through the broken
    window.

    I relate this, as it was the only occurrence of the kind that
    happened during my long and weary imprisonment; but it proved a
    comfort to me: the twitching of my flesh ceased, and I was fully
    satisfied from that moment that they would not get Joseph into
    Missouri, and that I should regain my freedom. From the best
    estimates that can be made, this incident occurred about the time
    when Joseph was in the custody of Reynolds.

    In a few days afterwards, Sheriff Reynolds came into the jail and
    told me that he had made a failure in the arrest of Joseph.

    After the lawyers had been about two months making out fresh
    papers, I was again conveyed to Liberty jail on a miserable horse,
    with feet and hands tied as before, but [by] a different road.

    In a few days afterwards, my mother found where I was, and she came
    to see me and brought me $100, whereby I was enabled to fee Mr.
    Doniphan for his services as counsel.

    The time of trial being continually delayed, I began to be uneasy.
    I was handcuffed in the dungeon, which is the basement story of the
    prison, and is about nine feet high. I took down the stove-pipe,
    pushed my clothes up through the stove-pipe hole, and then crawled
    through the hole in the floor, which was made of logs about
    fourteen inches thick, into the upper room. The hole was so small
    that it scratched my flesh, and made me bleed from many wounds. I
    then examined the inside door, and with the bail of the water pail
    I unbolted it; but finding I could not get through the outside
    door, I returned to my dungeon through the same narrow pass.

    The following night I made another attempt through the same way;
    but, failing to get through the outside door, I lay down on the
    upper floor, where the boys who were bringing my food next morning
    found me. They made an alarm, when five or six men came and again
    conveyed me down into the dungeon. It caused quite an excitement.

    My mother, learning that Mr. Doniphan had returned home, went to
    him, and prevailed on him to come and speak to me at the dungeon
    grate. While he was talking to me, a little boy, the son of a poor
    widow, about five or six years old, who had previously been to
    see me, finding I had no fire, had run home and brought some fire
    and chips to the grate. Mr. Doniphan said--"You little devil you,
    what are you doing here with this fire?" He replied, "I am going
    to give it to Mr. Rockwell, so that he can warm him." Doniphan
    then said--"You little devil you, take this fire and leave;" when
    the little urchin replied {141} (looking him in the face)--"Mr.
    Doniphan, you go to hell: I am going to give Mr. Rockwell this
    fire, so that he can warm him;" and he pushed it through the grate,
    gave me the chips, and continued to supply my daily wants of chips
    and fire while I continued in the dungeon.

    From Mr. Doniphan I learned that a special term of court was
    called, and my trial would come on in about fifteen days. The night
    following this visit, some men came to the grates of my dungeon,
    and asked if I wanted to get out. I told them, No, as I had been
    informed that day that I should have a trial in a fortnight. They
    replied--"Honor bright: if you wish to get out, we'll let you out
    in a few minutes." I replied that I would rather remain, as my
    trial would come on so soon. Next morning one of the men came, put
    some money in the cleft of a stick, and put it through the hole to
    me. He refused to tell his name; but I knew by his voice that he
    was one of the men who came to me in the night.

    The trial came on according to my last notification. I was tried
    for breaking Independence jail; and although the law of Missouri
    reads that, in order to break jail, a man must break a lock, a
    door, or a wall, still Judge King ruled that it was breaking jail
    to walk out when the door is open; and under this ruling the jury
    brought in a verdict of "five minutes' imprisonment in the county
    jail;" but I was kept there four or five hours, during which time
    several attempts were made to get up some other charge against me.

    About 8 p.m. on December 13th, General Doniphan took me out and
    told me I must take across the country on foot, and not walk on any
    traveled road, unless it was during the night, as they would be apt
    to follow and again take me, as they did not care on what grounds,
    so they could make me trouble.

    I accordingly started, accompanied by my mother, and went to the
    house of a widow, where I obtained my first supper in freedom for
    more than nine months. We then traveled two miles and obtained $4.

    I then took through the woods to the road, where I heard two men
    riding on horseback. I hid behind a shady tree, and overheard one
    of them say, "He has not been gone many minutes: we shall soon
    overtake him."

    I went round the houses and traveled in the fields by the side of
    the road. The moon was in its first quarter, and I traveled during
    the night about twenty-five miles. I carried a little food with me,
    and next day traveled on the road, and walked past Crooked River to
    a Mr. Taylor's, with all the skin off my feet.

    A neighbor offered to take me in for the night, if I would go back
    {142} two miles. I did so, found his wife very cross with her
    husband, who said, "Stranger, you see my wife is very cross. I have
    got some whisky; let's drink: my wife will soon have something to
    eat." When supper was eaten, she became good tempered. I stayed in
    peace through the night. Next morning I ate breakfast with them,
    and gave them fifty cents, when the man brought out a horse, and
    sent a little boy with me fourteen miles, which was a very great
    relief to my weary feet.

    The next night I stopped near where the Haun's Mill massacre took
    place.

    The third day I walked till noon, and then hired a man to carry
    me the remainder of the day for seventy-five cents. Stayed at a
    house where I was well acquainted; but the people did not recognize
    me, and I did not make myself known. Paid fifty cents for supper,
    lodging, breakfast, and being sent twelve miles on horseback the
    next morning.

    I then continued my journey about thirty miles, where I rested
    three days to recruit my feet. I was then carried twenty-five miles
    on horseback, and walked the same day twenty-five miles. The day
    following I walked forty miles, and then waited another day and
    engaged a man to carry me to Montrose, to which place I was three
    days in going. I immediately crossed the river to Nauvoo in a small
    boat, and came straight to the Mansion.

[Sidenote: Release of Daniel Avery.]

Daniel Avery was liberated from his imprisonment in Missouri by
_habeas corpus._ This was, no doubt, on account of our vigilance in
communicating with the Governor, and endeavoring to prosecute the
kidnappers, and continually making public the conduct of Missouri.

    A PLAN FOR WOMEN'S SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE TEMPLE.

    _(From the Millennial Star.)_

    We have much pleasure in publishing and recommending the following
    plan to be adopted amongst the sisters of the Church of Jesus
    Christ of Latter-day Saints in England. We believe that the
    completion of the Temple is as near the hearts of the sisters as
    to the hearts of the brethren, and that the following proposed
    [plan] will be responded to on the part of the English sisters in a
    manner that shall reflect honor upon themselves, and be materially
    instrumental in forwarding the great work.

    {143} NAUVOO, Dec. 25, 1843.

    _To the Sisters of the Church of Jesus Christ in England,
    Greeting_:--

    DEAR SISTERS:--This is to inform you that we have here entered into
    a small weekly subscription for the benefit of the Temple funds.
    One thousand have already joined it, while many more are expected,
    by which we trust to help forward the great work very much. The
    amount is only one cent or a halfpenny per week.

    As Brother Amos Fielding is waiting for this, I cannot enlarge
    more than to say that myself and Sister Thompson are engaged in
    collecting the same.

    We remain,

    Your affectionate sisters in Christ,

    MARY SMITH,

    M. R. THOMPSON.

    NAUVOO, Dec. 25, 1843.

    The ladies' subscription for the Temple, of one cent per week, is
    fully sanctioned by the First Presidency.

    HYRUM SMITH.

    We feel much to encourage this plan, and trust that the sisters in
    England will manifest that they will not be behind the sisters in
    Nauvoo in this laudable work. One thing in connection with this
    work we would mention, and request that it be attended to with the
    strictest accuracy; that is, that the name of each individual be
    recorded, and the amount which they subscribe, in order that such
    names may be transmitted to Nauvoo, where they will have to be
    entered in the books of the Lord's House. The sisters or others who
    may collect the subscriptions will please to be very particular on
    this point.

[Sidenote: Prophet's Joy at the Return of Rockwell and Avery.]

_Tuesday, 26.--_At home. I rejoiced that Rockwell had returned from
the clutches of Missouri, and that God had delivered him out of their
hands. Brother Daniel Avery also arrived about dusk this evening; and
the Missourians have no longer the pleasure of exulting over any Mormon
victims for the present; but their blood-thirstiness will not long be
satisfied unless they seek out another victim on whom to glut their
malice and vengeance.

Mr. Keith gave a lecture and concert of music in the assembly room this
evening.

    MR. ROCKWELL.

    _(Editorial from the Neighbor.)_

    The name of this individual is, no doubt, familiar to most of our
    readers. He has obtained some celebrity in the world also, not for
    his reputed virtue, but for his supposed crimes.

    It will be recollected that he is the person who was basely and
    falsely implicated, along with Joseph Smith, as the reputed [would
    be] murderer of ex-Governor Boggs, while Mr. Smith was charged with
    being accessory before the fact. A vexatious lawsuit was instituted
    against Joseph Smith, wherein he was charged with the above-named
    crime; and finally, after many attempts of the governor of Missouri
    to get him into his power, was acquitted by the United States Court
    for the district of Illinois,

    Stories of murder and blood were circulated from Maine to Missouri;
    they were iterated and reiterated by the newspapers of the whole
    Union, and painted in the most glowing colors that human ingenuity
    could invent. Mr. Rockwell was branded as a murderer, and Joseph
    Smith as accessory before the fact, without any other evidence
    than a story fabricated by some of our generous politicians,
    engendered in falsehood by hearts as dark as Erebus for religious
    and political effect.

    This demagoguery and political corruption has caused an innocent
    man to be immolated in a Missouri dungeon for upwards of eight
    months, without the slightest evidence of his guilt, or even the
    most remote evidence of crime leading to his committal. He was
    taken without process, and committed to jail upon mere supposition,
    and finally acquitted without any shadow of proof having been
    adduced from beginning to end. This is the way that Missouri treats
    free-born American citizens, and they can obtain no redress.

    Mr. Rockwell arrived here on Monday night, and has given us some
    of the details of his history since he was first taken in Missouri
    to the present time; and we can assure our readers that it will "a
    tale unfold" relative to that state, which even many of those who
    have been driven therefrom will find it difficult to believe that
    there did exist such monsters in human shape.

    deposeth and saith that on the 26th instant, as he was passing from
    Lima to Nauvoo, through that part of Hancock county where Colonel
    Levi Williams resides, he was credibly informed that on Saturday
    previous the anti-Mormons held a meeting, drew up an article, and
    passed several resolutions, among which were these:--"We will
    revere and hold sacred and inviolate the Constitution of the United
    States, and also the Constitution of this State. We will visit the
    Mormons residing in our vicinity and require them to give up their
    guns; and such as do it shall dwell here in peace; but those who
    will not do it may have thirteen days to leave in; and if they
    are not off in that time, we will drive them." The above is the
    substance, but perhaps not the very words. They also swear that the
    Mormons shall never raise another crop in that region, &c.; &c.,
    and further this deponent saith not.

Daniel Avery having made affidavit of the cruel treatment he had
recently received at the hands of Missourians, I here insert it:--

    _Affidavit of Daniel Avery--His Treatment in Missouri_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss.

    On the 28th day of December, 1843, came Daniel Avery before me,
    Joseph Smith, mayor of the city aforesaid, and after being duly
    sworn, deposeth and saith that on the second day of December,
    1843, he was unlawfully arrested by force and arms, and kidnapped
    at Doty's Mill in Bear Creek precinct, Hancock county, and State
    aforesaid, by Colonel Levi Williams, his son John Williams, of
    Hancock county; John Elliott, a schoolmaster, from four-and-a-half
    miles below Warsaw; William Middleton and Joseph McCoy, of Clark
    county, Missouri, and four {146} others. Colonel Williams held
    his bowie-knife to his breast. Six of the others stood with their
    pistols cocked and their fingers upon the triggers, muzzles
    presented at his body, ready to fire; and two stood with clubs, and
    amidst the most horrid oaths and imprecations, took and bound with
    silk handkerchiefs your said affiant, and led him away between two
    men, one holding a savage bowie-knife on one side, and the other
    a cocked pistol on the other side, (having taken away your said
    affiant's weapons while binding him in the mill,) and led your
    affiant about a mile. Your affiant refused to walk any further, and
    they put him upon a horse, and tied his legs under the horse; and
    John Elliott, the aforesaid schoolmaster, led the horse as fast as
    he could make his way, through a thicket and by-way to the house of
    the aforesaid Colonel Williams. Here the kidnappers ate and drank;
    and after they had unbound me, (for they had bound me so tight that
    I was in great pain,) I was also suffered to partake.

    They then put me upon the horse again, and bound me, and started
    for the river, the said schoolmaster Elliott leading the horse.
    When we came near a schoolhouse where there was a meeting, they
    came to a halt, sent messengers to the meeting, and in the course
    of half an hour they returned with an armed mob, with rifles and
    other weapons, sufficient to make the whole company number about
    twenty. Being all on horseback, they formed a circle, with your
    affiant in the center, who up to that time had acquainted every
    man he saw that _they were kidnapping him_, and marched in that
    order to a house on a point below Warsaw; and as I was very cold
    from being bound, they took me into the house to warm. I now called
    for a trial, as I had told them all the way that I never resisted
    legal authority. They said they were hunting a magistrate. Said
    I, "I understand you; you mean to force me into Missouri." McCoy
    returned, and said, "We are ready." It was about midnight. We went
    about three hundred yards up the river to a skiff. I refused to
    cross as they had promised me a trial. They forced me into a skiff
    and bound me, and five men put me across. Their names, so far as
    I could ascertain, are William Middleton, William Clark, Joseph
    McCoy, John Elliott, and Charles Coolidge. They landed at the
    tavern on the south side of the Des Moines, and took me into a back
    room, threw down a buffalo robe for my bed; but as my arms were
    bound so tight that I could not rest, I complained; told Middleton
    that was not the way he was used at my house. They felt at my arms
    and exclaimed, "By God, they are not too tight!" I begged to have
    one arm liberated, and finally they untied both, and I slept (under
    guard) on the buffalo robe before the fire.

    About noon they got ready and started with me, guarded upon a
    horse, for McCoy's in Clark county, Missouri, about twelve miles
    distant. {147} It being night when we arrived, and I unwell
    through fatigue and confinement and the abuses before received, I
    went to bed. They had sent runners ahead; and after I had been in
    bed awhile, the sheriff came up from Waterloo, the county seat,
    a distance of about two miles, to arrest me and take me before
    a magistrate that night; but Middleton and McCoy objected, as I
    was sick. The sheriff, however, executed his writ, and left me in
    their care till morning. It being late before we breakfasted, he
    came in the morning and made the second scope of his authority and
    took me. He quizzed me the night before, to draw something out for
    testimony; but as innocence cannot be affected by truth, he was as
    wise at one end of the story as the other.

    At Waterloo I was examined by a magistrate, who committed me upon
    the substance of an affidavit made by my son in duress with a
    bowie-knife at his breast, and upon a promise that he should be
    liberated from Monticello jail, where he was confined after being
    kidnapped some three or four weeks previous. My bonds were fixed at
    $1000; and as I had no bail in such a strange place, I was started
    for Palmyra jail, in Marion county. The deputy sheriff took me to
    Musgrove, the sheriff, a distance of ten miles. Here I sued out a
    writ of habeas corpus, but the judge remanded me to prison.

    At Monticello my chains were taken off, and I was at liberty in the
    midst of a strong guard to view the town. Here a lawyer agreed to
    take me and my son through court (as the Missourians say,) for a
    horse. Saw my son in the prison; said he was forced at the point of
    a bowie-knife to make an affidavit against me; but he knew I was
    innocent.

    I tried to be left with him in jail; but no, I was compelled to go
    to Palmyra, where I arrived the next evening. The sheriff thrust me
    into the dungeon without waiting to eat, warm, or anything else.
    The next morning the blacksmith came into the jail and ironed me
    to the middle of a great chain that was fast to the floor, where I
    remained in the horrid gloom of a Missouri prison two weeks.

    From thence the deputy sheriff started, with me chained upon the
    horse in this wise. He then chained my right leg, and then passed
    the chain up to my left hand. In this way I traveled nine miles,
    when we stopped, and he changed the chain from my hand to the
    horse's neck. We arrived at Monticello, and I was chained all night.

    The next day I was conveyed to Waterloo, and delivered into the
    custody of the sheriff of Clark county. I was kept under a strong
    guard by day, and at night chained to one of the guards or to the
    bedpost.

    {148} I was informed that Middleton and McCoy procured an
    indictment against me, by giving bonds to the amount of some two
    or three hundred dollars, that they would hunt up testimony to
    the point for next court, there being nothing against me but the
    affidavit of my son before alluded to; and so the grand jury found
    a bill.

    Ellison, my lawyer, deceived me, and put over my case for six
    months, because, as I suppose, I, being kidnapped, had no fees for
    him. I objected to having my trial put off for six months. I did
    not fancy the dungeon of Palmyra prison. The court concluded to
    let me to bail under bonds of $1000, but this I could not obtain.
    Subsequently it was reduced to $500, but all in vain, for I was
    unacquainted with the people.

    This was on Saturday, and I was thus left to meditate on the
    mischief that may be made out of a little matter by meddlesome men.

    On Monday I sued out a writ of habeas corpus; and after a fair
    hearing of the matter, I received the following order:--

    STATE OF MISSOURI,

    COUNTY OF CLARK. ss.

The Mayor said--

    _Address of the Mayor to the Nauvoo Police_.

    It is expected that a part will be on duty while others rest. It
    might be expected that thieves had crept into the Church for the
    purpose of concealing their wickedness under the garb of sanctity.

    It is an abominable thing to set a thief to catch a thief; and I
    would look with the utmost contempt upon men who do this as guilty
    of a mean or cowardly act.

    Some city councils have taken thieves out of their prisons, and
    employed them as policemen, under the old and foolish adage--"Set a
    rogue to catch a rogue," which is decidedly wrong, and is corrupt
    in policy.

    You will act under the direction of Jonathan Dunham--we will call
    him High Policeman. In reality he is the captain of the police: but
    as men are apt to be frightened at a military title, we will use s
    civil title, as these policemen are all civil officers of the city.

    Captain Dunham is the man to send after a thief. He will not come
    back, after following him a mile, to ask if he may shoot him, if
    he resists. Some men have strange ears and changeable hearts: they
    become transformed from their original purity and integrity, and
    become altogether different from what they were.

    If the bloodthirsty hell-hounds of Missouri continue their
    persecution, we will be forbearing, until we are compelled to
    strike; then do it decently and in good order, and break the yoke
    effectually, so that it cannot be mended. The mob have been so
    repulsed in their last attempt at kidnapping, they may stand in
    fear, at least for a short time.

    We will be in peace with all men, so long as they will mind their
    own business and let us alone. Even "Peace with Missouri" shall
    be the motto of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
    from this {151} time forth, if they will stop their persecution
    and oppressive warfare against us. Let them alone, for they stink
    in the nostrils of the Almighty: let them alone. Porter Rockwell
    has come home clear. A Missouri grand jury could not find a bill
    against him even in Jackson county; and that proves me clear of the
    charge of being accessory of shooting Lilburn W. Boggs. Many of our
    difficulties from the State of Missouri are hurled upon us through
    the influence of some of our near neighbors.

    Governor Ford has boasted of being a law-abiding man. A governor
    certainly should be law-abiding. It is therefore our best policy to
    acquaint the Executive, by affidavits, of every violation of our
    rights, so that when the onset comes, he will be obliged by law to
    send the militia to our support. Let us keep cool as a cucumber on
    a frosty morning. Do not be excited. Say nothing about Missouri's
    oppression. "A soft answer turns away wrath but grievous words stir
    up anger," therefore we "poor pussy" this generation.

    Keep a strict account of the time you serve as policemen. Have
    the ordinances of the city always in your possession, and study
    them, sad ferret out all grogshops, gambling-houses, brothels, and
    disorderly conduct; and if a transgressor resists, cuff his ears.
    If anyone lifts a weapon or presents a pistol at you, take his
    life, if need be, to preserve your own; but enforce the ordinances,
    and preserve the peace of the city, and take care of your own
    lives. Let no horses be taken away out of the city, or anything
    else stolen, if you can help it.

    Let Missouri alone. Keep out of her territory. Don't go over there
    on any business whatever. Any of this people would be subject to
    cruel abuse, if found in that State, in the same manner that Porter
    Rockwell has been. He was seized in St. Louis while attending to
    his lawful business, picked up and ironed, and thrown in jail
    without any form of law, conveyed to Independence in the custody of
    a ruffian who swore falsely in the hope of getting a reward, kept
    in irons all the way, lodged in Independence jail without even the
    form of an inquiry, chained double in a filthy, damp, unventilated
    dungeon,--chained hand and foot, so that he could not straighten
    for months, till his body was reduced to a mere skeleton, and he
    unable to walk when the irons were taken off, and he had to be
    led,--half fed on the refuse of what dogs would not eat: his case
    presented to a Jackson county grand jury, and not evidence enough
    to warrant them in even finding an indictment. After which, the
    Missouri court, in the plenitude of their justice, transmitted the
    innocent and unindicted man back to the dungeon, without fire,
    provisions, or any other comfort,--hoping by this torture, no
    doubt, to produce death, or force him to accede to an infamous
    proposition, "that whether Jo Smith was guilty or innocent, only
    come out against {152} him, you shall have your liberty, and
    receive a liberal reward." After months have passed away, without
    any shadow of law, the door is opened, and he is told to "slip off
    privately, or the people will hang you." Keep out of Missouri, if
    you don't want such treatment as this; for the Averys, Rockwell,
    and many others have been thankful to get away with their lives.

    If any man attempts to bribe you in any way whatever, or persuade
    you to neglect your duty, tell the same to me. Let us have a
    reformation.

    There are speculators in this State who are wanting to sell
    revolving pistols to us, in order to fight the Missourians, and at
    the same time inciting the Missourians to fight us. Don't buy: it
    would be better to buy ploughshares and raise corn with them.

    My life is more in danger from some little dough-head of a fool in
    this city than from all my numerous and inveterate enemies abroad.
    I am exposed to far greater danger from traitors among ourselves
    than from enemies without, although my life has been sought for
    many years by the civil and military authorities, priests, and
    people of Missouri; and if I can escape from the ungrateful
    treachery of assassins, I can live as Caesar might have lived, were
    it not for a right-hand Brutus. I have had pretended friends betray
    me. All the enemies upon the face of the earth may roar and exert
    all their power to bring about my death, but they can accomplish
    nothing, unless some who are among us and enjoy our society, have
    been with us in our councils, participated in our confidence, taken
    us by the hand, called us brother, saluted us with a kiss, join
    with our enemies, turn our virtues into faults, and, by falsehood
    and deceit, stir up their wrath and indignation against us, and
    bring their united vengeance upon our heads. All the hue-and-cry of
    the chief priests and elders against the Savior, could not bring
    down the wrath of the Jewish nation upon His head, and thereby
    cause the crucifixion of the Son of God, until Judas said unto
    them, "Whomsoever I shall kiss, he is the man; hold him fast."
    Judas was one of the Twelve Apostles, even their treasurer, and
    dipt with their Master in the dish, and through his treachery, the
    crucifixion was brought about; and _we have a Judas in our midst_.

    _The Mayor blesses the Police_.

    It shall be said in time to come, Where are our old policemen? Let
    us have one of the old policemen, to stand at our window, guard our
    interest, and protect our families, and we shall be safe.

    If you will magnify your office, the full confidence of Israel
    shall be the blessing that shall be conferred on you in time to
    come.

{153} Counselor Hyrum Smith spoke of the importance of the police
office.

The Mayor said that if any one offered a bribe to a policeman, the city
will pay that policeman twice the amount offered for the information,
when reported to the Mayor.

_Friday, 29.--_My clerk made copies of five affidavits made yesterday
by Elder Orson Hyde, Mr. Daniel Avery, and others, and sent the same to
the Governor, with the following letter:--

    _Letter to Governor Ford--Accompanying Affidavits_.

    NAUVOO, December 30, 1843.

    SIR:--I forward to your Excellency a number of affidavits relative
    to the late kidnapping of the Averys, and upon other matters.
    When the mob made efforts to resist the laws, Joseph Smith, as
    Mayor, gave notice to Major-General Law to hold a portion of the
    Nauvoo Legion in readiness; and Aaron Johnson, Esq., called for
    some troops to maintain the laws: but I am happy to say, none were
    ordered to march, as it was deemed most advisable to let Colonel
    Levi Williams and his mob flourish until indictments could be made
    at the Circuit Court of Hancock county.

    We shall continue to keep your Excellency informed upon all matters
    of moment touching the premises.

_Saturday, 30.--_At nine, a.m., held Mayor's court. Two boys, Roswell
and Evander White, were brought up for stealing six hens and a rooster.
They were sentenced to pay for the fowls, and to ten days' hard labor
each on the streets.

In the afternoon, met in the assembly room with the quorum. William Law
and wife were not present. Warm and rainy.

_Sunday, 31st.--_At home.

In the afternoon, called with Elder Parley P. Pratt to see his wife.

At early candle-light, went to prayer-meeting; administered the
sacrament; after which I retired. At midnight, about fifty musicians
and singers sang Phelps' New Year's Hymn under my window.

{154} Warm and rainy. No ice to be seen.

The subjoined list shows a few of the publications for and against the
Saints during the year.

    _Pro et con Mormonism, publications for the year 1843_.

    The _Alton Telegraph_ published several very severe articles
    against the Church.

    Edward Brotherton published a scurrilous pamphlet at Manchester,
    England, entitled "Mormonism--its Rise and Progress, and the
    Prophet Joseph Smith."

    The _Richmond Palladium_ published an amusing and favorable article
    on "Mormonism."

    The _Boston Bee_ published a series of articles favorable to the
    Saints, which had a beneficial effect in putting down prejudice and
    misrepresentation.

    A favorable account of a visit to Nauvoo was published by Samuel A.
    Prior, Methodist minister.

    The _Morning Star,_ a Freewill Baptist paper, published a long and
    bitter article against the Latter-day Saints, entitled "Mormon
    Perversion."

    A favorable article, entitled "Nauvoo and Mormonism," was published
    by a Traveler.

    The _Quincy Whig_ published several bitter articles against me.

    The _Warsaw Message,_ and subsequently the _Warsaw Signal_,
    published a continual tirade of abuse, misrepresentation, and lies
    against the Saints.

    The _New Haven_ (Con.) _Herald_ published a favorable account of
    the "Mormons" in Nauvoo.

Footnotes:

1. There was also a Memorial prepared by the Prophet from the
inhabitants of Hancock county generally to the same effect as the
above, but it was never extensively signed or presented to Congress.

2. This man afterwards was discovered to be an adventurer and a most
desperate character. Gregg in his Prophet of Palmyra, Chapter XXX,
speaks of him as "an adventurer of fine appearance and gentlemanly
manners, who appeared in the county (Hancock) during the troubles; went
to Nauvoo, and became intimate with Smith and the leaders; afterwards
turned against them--went to Warsaw and issued a pamphlet--claiming to
be an expose of Mormonism and the evil purposes and practices of the
Prophet * * * He was an entire stranger to the county and its people;
no one knew whence he came or what became of him afterwards, when the
excitement was all over. Hence it is just to say, that the equivocal
position in which he stood very justly tended to lessen confidence
of the public in his statements, and his little book made slight
impression. The Mormons charged that he was an adventurer of the worst
class--himself a counterfeiter, etc., and that he quarreled with the
Prophet and the authorities because he was detected and exposed." Gregg
also says that this "Expose was much of the same character as that of
General Bennett's." (Ibid).

_Monday, January 1, 1844.--_A cold, blustering rainstorm ushered in the
new year.

At sunrise, Thomas Miller, James Leach, James Bridges, and John
Frodsham were brought before me by the police, charged with disorderly
conduct. Fined Miller $5: the others were discharged.

[Sidenote: New Year's at the Mansion.]

A large party took a new year's supper at my house, and had music and
dancing till morning. I was in my private room with my family, Elder
John Taylor and other friends.

_Tuesday 2.--_Two p.m., Hyrum Dayton was brought before Mayor's
court for disorderly conduct in resisting and abusing the police:
fined $25 and costs. His son, Lysander Dayton, for the same offense,
was sentenced to ten days' hard labor, on the public streets; and
subsequently, for contempt of court, ten days more.

Snow one inch deep.

I here insert Mr. Calhoun's answer to my letter of inquiry, dated
November 4, 1843:--

    _Letter: John C. Calhoun to Joseph Smith--Defining What Former's
    Policy would be Towards the Saints if Elected President_.

    FORT HILL, December 2, 1843.

    SIR:--You ask me what would be my rule of action relative the
    Mormons {156} or Latter-day Saints, should I be elected President;
    to which I answer, that if I should be elected, I would strive to
    administer the government according to the Constitution and the
    laws of the union; and that as they make no distinction between
    citizens of different religious creeds I should make none. As far
    as it depends on the Executive department, all should have the full
    benefit of both, and none should be exempt from their operation.

    But as you refer to the case of Missouri, candor compels me to
    repeat what I said to you at Washington, that, according to my
    views, the case does not come within the jurisdiction of the
    Federal Government, which is one of limited and specific powers.

    With respect, I am, &c., &c.,

    J. C. CALHOUN.

    Mr. JOSEPH SMITH.

To which I wrote the following reply:--

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to John C. Calhoun--The Latter's Policy
    Towards the Latter-day Saints, if Elected President of the U. S.
    Considered_.

    NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, January 2, 1844.

    Sir:--Your reply to my letter of last November, concerning your
    rule of action towards the Latter-day Saints, if elected President,
    is at hand; and that you and your friends of the same opinion
    relative to the matter in question may not be disappointed as to
    me or my mind upon so grave a subject, permit me, as a law-abiding
    man, as a well-wisher to the perpetuity of constitutional rights
    and liberty, and as a friend to the free worship of Almighty God by
    all, according to the dictates of every person's own conscience, to
    say that_ I am surprised_ that a man or men in the highest stations
    of public life should have made up such a fragile "view" of a case,
    than which there is not one on the face of the globe fraught with
    so much consequence to the happiness of men in this world or the
    world to come.

    To be sure, the first paragraph of your letter appears very
    complacent and fair on a white sheet of paper. And who, that is
    ambitious for greatness and power, would not have said the same
    thing? Your oath binds you to support the Constitution and laws;
    and as all creeds and religions are alike tolerated, they must
    of course, all be justified or condemned according to merit or
    demerit. But why--tell me why are all the principal men held up
    for public stations _so cautiously careful_, not to publish to the
    world that they will _judge a righteous judgment, law or no law?_
    for laws and opinions, like the vanes of steeples, change with the
    wind.

    One Congress passes a law, another repeals it; and one statesman
    says that the Constitution means this, and another that; and who
    does {157} not know that all may be wrong? the opinion and pledge,
    therefore, in the first paragraph of your reply to my question,
    like the forced steam from the engine of a steam-boat, makes the
    show of a bright cloud at first; but when it comes in contact with
    a purer atmosphere, dissolves to common air again.

    Your second paragraph leaves you naked before yourself, like a
    likeness in a mirror, when you say, that according to your _view,_
    the Federal Government is "one of limited and specific powers," and
    has no jurisdiction in the case of the "Mormons." So then a State
    can at any time expel any portion of her citizens with impunity:
    and, in the language of Mr. Van Buren, frosted over with your
    gracious _"views of the case,"_ though the cause is ever so just,
    Government can do nothing for them, because it has no power.

    Go on, then, Missouri, after another set of inhabitants (as the
    Latter-day Saints did,) have entered some two or three hundred
    thousand dollars' worth of land, and made extensive improvements
    thereon; go on, then, I say; banish the occupants or owners, or
    kill them, as the mobbers did many of the Latter-day Saints, and
    take their land and property as spoil; and let the Legislature,
    as in the case of the "Mormons," appropriate a couple of hundred
    thousand dollars to pay the mob for doing that job; for the
    renowned Senator from South Carolina, Mr. J. C. Calhoun, says the
    powers of the Federal Government are so _specific and limited that
    it has no jurisdiction of the case!_ O ye people who groan under
    the oppression of tyrants!--ye exiled Poles, who have felt the iron
    hand of Russian grasp!--ye poor and unfortunate among all nations!
    come to the asylum of the oppressed; buy ye lands of the General
    Government; pay in your money to the treasury to strengthen the
    army and the navy; worship God according to the dictates of your
    own consciences; pay in your taxes to support the great heads of a
    glorious nation: but remember a _"sovereign State"_ is so much more
    powerful than the United States, the parent Government, that it
    can exile you at pleasure, mob you with impunity, confiscate your
    lands and property, have the Legislature sanction it,--yea, even
    murder you as an edict of an emperor, _and it does no wrong;_ for
    the noble Senator of South Carolina says the power of the federal
    Government is _so limited and specific, that it has no jurisdiction
    of the case!_ What think ye of _imperium in imperio_?

    Ye spirits of the blessed of all ages, hark! Ye shades of departed
    statesmen, listen! Abraham, Moses, Homer, Socrates, Solon, Solomon,
    and all that ever thought of right and wrong, look down from
    your exaltations if you have any; for it is said, "In the midst
    of counselors there _is safety_;" and when you have learned that
    fifteen thousand innocent citizens, after having purchased their
    lands of the United States {158} and paid for them, were expelled
    from a "sovereign State," by order of the Governor, at the point
    of the bayonet, their arms taken from them by the same authority,
    and their right of migration into said State denied, under pain
    of imprisonment, whipping, robbing, mobbing, and even death, and
    no justice or recompense allowed; and, from the Legislature with
    the Governor at the head, down to the Justice of the Peace, with a
    bottle of whisky in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other, hear
    them all declare that there is no justice for a "Mormon" in that
    State; and judge ye a righteous judgment, and tell me when the
    virtue of the States was stolen, where the honor of the General
    Government lies hid, and what clothes a senator with wisdom. O
    nullifying Carolina! O little tempestuous Rhode Island! Would it
    not be well for the great men of the nation to read the fable
    of the _partial judge;_ and when part of the free citizens of a
    State had been expelled contrary to the Constitution, mobbed,
    robbed, plundered, and many murdered, instead of searching into the
    course taken with Joanna Southcott, Ann Lee, the French Prophets,
    the Quakers of New England, and rebellious negroes in the slave
    Slates, to hear both sides and then judge, rather than have the
    mortification to say, "Oh, it is _my_ bull that has killed _your_
    ox! That alters the case! I must inquire into it; _and if, and
    if_--!"

    If the General Government has no power to reinstate expelled
    citizens to their rights, there is a monstrous hypocrite fed
    and fostered from the hard earnings of the people! A real "bull
    beggar" upheld by sycophants. And although you may wink to the
    priests to stigmatize, wheedle the drunkards to swear, and raise
    the hue-and-cry of--"Impostor! false prophet! G--d--n old Joe
    Smith!" yet remember, if the Latter-day Saints are not restored
    to all their rights and paid for all their losses, according to
    the known rules of justice and judgment, reciprocation and common
    honesty among men, that God will come out of His hiding place, and
    vex this nation with a sore vexation: yea, the consuming wrath
    of an offended God shall smoke through the nation with as much
    distress and woe as independence has blazed through with pleasure
    and delight. Where is the strength of Government? Where is the
    patriotism of a Washington, a Warren, and Adams? And where is a
    spark from the watch-fire of '76, by which one candle might be lit
    that would glimmer upon the confines of Democracy? Well may it be
    said that one man is not a state, nor one state the nation.

    In the days of General Jackson, when France refused the first
    instalment for spoliations, there was power, force, and honor
    enough to resent injustice and insult, and the money came: and
    shall Missouri, filled with negro-drivers and white men stealers,
    go "unwhipped of justice" for tenfold greater sins than France? No!
    verily, no! While {159} I have powers of body and mind--while water
    runs and grass grows--while virtue is lovely and vice hateful; and
    while a stone points out a sacred spot where a fragment of American
    liberty once was, I or my posterity will plead the cause of injured
    innocence, until Missouri makes atonement for all her sins, or
    sinks disgraced, degraded, and damned to hell, "where the worm
    dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."

    Why, sir, the powers not delegated to the United States and the
    States belong to the people, and Congress sent to do the people's
    business have all power; and shall fifteen thousand citizens groan
    in exile? O vain men! will ye not, if ye do not restore them to
    their rights and $2,000,000 worth of property, relinquish to
    them, (the Latter-day Saints,) as a body, their portion of power
    that belongs to them according to the Constitution? Power has its
    convenience as well as inconvenience. "The world was not made for
    Caesar alone, but for Cassius too."

    I will give you a parable. A certain lord had a vineyard in a
    goodly land, which men labored in at their pleasure. A few meek
    men also went and purchased with money from some of these chief
    men that labored at pleasure a portion of land in the vineyard,
    at a very remote part of it, and began to improve it, and to eat
    and drink the fruit thereof,--when some vile persons, who regarded
    not man, neither feared the lord of the vineyard, rose up suddenly
    and robbed these meek men, and drove them from their possessions,
    killing many.

    This barbarous act made no small stir among the men in the
    vineyard; and all that portion who were attached to that part of
    the vineyard where the men were robbed rose up in grand council,
    with their chief man, who had firstly ordered the deed to be done,
    and made a covenant not to pay for the cruel deed, but to keep the
    spoil, and never let those meek men set their feet on that soil
    again, neither recompense them for it.

    Now, these meek men, in their distress, wisely sought redress
    of those wicked men in every possible manner, and got none.
    They then supplicated the chief men, who held the vineyard at
    pleasure, and who had the power to sell and defend it, for redress
    and redemption; and those men, loving the fame and favor of
    the multitude more than the glory of the lord of the vineyard,
    answered--"Your cause is just, but we can do nothing for you,
    because we have no power."

    Now, when the lord of the vineyard saw that virtue and innocence
    were not regarded, and his vineyard occupied by wicked men, he
    sent men and took the possession of it to himself, and destroyed
    those unfaithful servants, and appointed them their portion among
    hypocrites.

    And let me say that all men who say that Congress has no power to
    restore and defend the rights of her citizens have not the love of
    the truth abiding in them. Congress has power to protect the nation
    against {160} foreign invasion and internal broil; and whenever
    that body passes an act to maintain right with any power, or to
    restore right to any portion of her citizens, it is the _supreme
    law of the land;_ and should a State refuse submission, that State
    is guilty of _insurrection or rebellion,_ and the President has
    as much power to repel it as Washington had to march against the
    "whisky boys at Pittsburgh," or General Jackson had to send an
    armed force to suppress the rebellion of South Carolina.

    To close, I would admonish you, before you let your _"candor
    compel"_ you again to write upon a subject great as the salvation
    of man, consequential as the life of the Savior, broad as the
    principles of eternal truth, and valuable as the jewels of
    eternity, to read in the 8th section and 1st article of the
    Constitution of the United States, the _first, fourteenth_ and
    _seventeenth_ "specific" and not very "limited powers" of the
    Federal Government, what can be done to protect the lives, property
    and rights of a virtuous people, when the administrators of the law
    and law-makers are unbought by bribes, uncorrupted by patronage,
    untempted by gold, unawed by fear, and uncontaminated tangling
    alliances--even like Caesar's wife, not only _unspotted, but
    unsuspected!_ And God, who cooled the heat of a Nebuchadnezzar's
    furnace or shut the mouths of lions for the honor of a Daniel, will
    raise your mind above the narrow notion that the General Government
    has no power, to the sublime idea that Congress, with the President
    as Executor, is as almighty in its sphere as Jehovah is in his.

    With great respect, I have the honor to be

    Your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    HON. ("MR") J. C. CALHOUN,

    Fort Hill, S. C.

[Sidenote: Release of Pugmire and Cartwright from Prison, England.]

Jonathan Pugmire, Senior, and Thomas Cartwright discharged by Judge
Whitehead, at Chester, England. The judge would not allow the costs
of prosecution or witnesses to be paid by the Crown. It was very
evident that the Church of England ministers were at the bottom of the
machinations, and were sorely discomfited at the result. I insert the
statement of the unfortunate occurrence given by Jonathan Pugmire,
Junior:--

    _Cartwright Drowning--Accident at a Baptism in England_.

    Thomas Cartwright was baptized November 6, 1843, unknown to his
    wife, by Elder Jonathan Pugmire, Senior; but she had mistrusted he
    {161} had gone to the water, and went to Pugmire's house the same
    evening, and inquired where Tom was, (meaning her husband). Mrs.
    Pugmire answered she did not know.

    After this, Mrs. Cartwright went out and met them returning from
    the waters of baptism, and shouted--"Damn you, I'll dip ye!" and
    expressing her determination to have revenge on Pugmire's family,
    she used a great deal of very bad language.

    Some of the neighbors (not belonging to the Church) advised her not
    to speak too much against the Latter-day Saints, as she might yet
    become convinced of the truth of their doctrines and be baptized
    herself. She replied, "I hope to God, if ever I am such a fool,
    that I'll be drowned in the attempt!"

    A short time afterwards, in consequence of her husband talking
    to her about the truths of the Gospel, she consented to go to
    Pugmire's house and hear for herself.

    After attending a few times she told her husband she had a dream,
    in which she saw it was a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the
    living God, and requested to be baptized.

    Mrs. Pugmire talked with her, reminding her of her harsh
    expression. She confessed all, and said, "I am very sorry; and as
    my conduct is known to all this neighborhood, I do not wish to have
    my baptism public, but to have it done privately; and I wish no
    female to accompany me to the water but you."

    On the night of her baptism (November 23, 1843), she was conducted
    to the water by her husband and Elder Pugmire, witnessed by Mrs.
    Pugmire and James Moore. Previous to this time, Elder Pugmire had
    baptized eight or ten persons in the same place.

    On arriving at the water, they found the creek had overflowed its
    banks, in consequence of a heavy rain which had fallen that day.
    Elder Pugmire examined its banks, and concluded he could attend to
    the ordinance without going into the regular bed of the creek.

    This was done; but on raising Mrs. Cartwright, and as they were
    walking out, they both went under the water.

    It was afterwards discovered that the water had undermined the
    bank, and it gave way under their feet. Meantime, Thomas Cartwright
    leaped into the creek and seized hold of his wife's petticoat; but
    the water carried her off, and left the garment in his hand.

    James Moore got hold of Elder Pugmire by the hair of his head, Mrs.
    Pugmire holding Moore's hand, and thus they dragged him out.

    Moore then ran to the village to give the alarm. On his return, he
    found Cartwright about one hundred yards from where he leaped in,
    {162} with his head above water, holding on to the stump of a tree.
    He said he could not have remained in that situation one minute
    longer.

    George Knowlen swam the stream and got him out; but his wife was
    not found until the day following, when she was found about two
    hundred yards from where the accident occurred, standing upon her
    feet, with her head above water, the stream having fallen about two
    feet.

    On Pugmire reaching home, a Church of England minister had him
    arrested and dragged from his family the same evening, and kept in
    custody of a constable until a coroner's inquest was held on the
    body of the deceased.

    After she was buried, Cartwright was arrested, and both were sent
    to Chester jail, to wait their trial before the judge of assize.
    They were in confinement six weeks and three days before their
    trial came on.

    The judge (Whitehead) remarked to the jury that baptism was an
    ordinance of our religion, and that it was a mere accident which
    had occurred. He advised the jurymen to be very careful how they
    examined the case before them--that it was an ordinance instituted
    by God (at that moment the Lord spoke by the voice of thunder,
    which shook the court house,) and advised the prisoners to be very
    careful in the future to select a proper place for the performance
    of that rite. They were then set free.

    During their imprisonment, Pugmire had a vision, in which he was
    informed that they would be liberated; and he told Cartwright to be
    of good cheer, for they certainly would be acquitted.

_Wednesday 3_.--At home.

At noon, met with the City Council. The following is a copy of the
minutes:--

    _Difficulty of Wm. Law et al. With the Police_.

    SPECIAL CITY COUNCIL, Jan. 3, 1834, 2 o'clock.

    Names of members called. All present.

    The mayor directed the marshal to notify William Law and John
    Snyder that the council was in session, and informed the council
    that William Law had said to his brother Hyrum that the police had
    been sworn by him (the Prophet) secretly to put Law out of the way.
    [The Prophet said] "I have had no private conversation with any of
    the police but the high policeman, Jonathan Dunham, and that was
    to request him to have especial care of my personal safety, as I
    apprehended attempts to kidnap me by the Missourians." He called
    on the policemen to say if they had received any private oath from
    him, when they all said, "No."

    Councilor Hyrum Smith said that William Law told him the police
    {163} had sworn him (Law) to keep the secret, which was that he was
    to be put out of the way in three months.

    The mayor said he wished policemen to understand forever that all
    he wanted was that they should execute the ordinances of the city
    and his orders according to law.

    Several of the police called for the individual to be named who
    made the statement to William Law.

    The mayor said he thought proper that William Law should come and
    make his statement to the council on oath.

    The mayor then said to the police, "If you see a man stealing, and
    you have told him three times to stand, and warned him that he is
    a dead man if he does not stand, and he runs shoot off his legs.
    The design of the office of the police is to stop thieving; but an
    enemy should not be harmed until he draws weapons upon you."

    William Law came in, and was sworn to tell the whole truth touching
    the case before the council.

    William Law said he had been informed that some of the policemen
    had had another oath administered besides the one administered to
    them publicly: that one of them said there was a Judas in General
    Smith's cabinet,--one who stood next to him; and he must be taken
    care of, and that he must not be allowed to go into the world,
    but must be taken care of; and he was not only a dough-head and a
    traitor like Judas, but an assassin like Brutus: that the idea had
    been advanced that the scriptures support such a doctrine.

    _Alderman Harris._ Who is the person? and who told you?

    _Law._ I am under obligations _not_ to tell.

    _Alderman Harris._ That is immaterial. You are bound to disclose
    the whole truth here by virtue of your oath.

    _Law._ I am afraid to tell. One oath is as good as another.

    The Mayor said he would protect him. He was bound to tell.

    _Law._ Eli Norton told me.

    _Alderman Harris_. Was Eli Norton of the police?

    _Law._ No; but he got his information from Daniel Carn, who is a
    policeman.

    The marshal was sent to bring Eli Norton.

    The mayor said to the police--"On conditions I have had no private
    conversation with any of you, rise up and change the breech of your
    gun upwards," when all arose and changed the positions of their
    guns as indicated.

    Counselor Hyrum Smith considered the matter very alarming when
    he heard it. He referred to Dr. Sampson Avard's and John Carl's
    treachery and false swearing in Missouri, and rehearsed what was
    said by the mayor to the police in the former council.

    {164} The mayor said, "The reason why I made the remarks I did
    was on account of the reports brought from Missouri jail by O. P.
    Rockwell, that my enemies were determined to get me into their
    power and take my life, and thereby thought they would accomplish
    the overthrow of 'Mormonism.' And to enable them to effect this,
    they had secured the services of some of my most confidential
    friends, whom I did not suspect, and who were living in Nauvoo, to
    deliver me into their hands so that their religious organizations
    upon their own principles might stand; for they feared that
    'Mormonism' would destroy their present religious creeds,
    organizations, and orthodox systems. They did not design to try me,
    but hang me, or take my life anyhow: that they had a man in our
    midst who would fix me out, if they could not get me into their
    power without." He then referred to his remarks at the previous
    council.

    Minutes of last council being called for, were then read.

    Eli Norton sworn.

    _Question by the Mayor_ Did Carn say I had administered a private
    oath?

    Norton. No. Did not say much about Law. Did not say you had ever
    administered any private oath. Carn never intimated to me that
    Law must be put out of the way. Did not call William Law's name,
    nor any other name. Did not say the policemen had received a
    private oath. Understood Carn to say they had received private
    instructions; and if a man could not keep a secret, he was not
    worthy of a place in the Church. Did not say the mayor had given
    him a private charge. Did not tell where the danger was expected to
    come from. Told me there were dough-heads about. Did not say the
    dough-heads were in danger, but the mayor was in danger from the
    dough-heads.

    _Question by William Law:_ Did you not understand from Brother
    Carn that he was suspicious of some person near Joseph being a
    dough-head, and that that person was myself?

    _Answer:_ He mentioned a dough-head as being very near Joseph,
    and he guessed you was the man; and I thought it might be that
    Daniteism was not done with.

    _Mayor:_ Tell what you know that made you so alarmed about Brother
    Law.

    _Answer:_ There was no chain to the conversation; but I drew
    the inference that Brother Law was the dough-head from Carn's
    conversation; but Carn did not name Law.

    _Daniel Carn was sworn:_ Said, "I told Brother Norton that certain
    men had been counseled by the Prophet to invest their means in
    publishing the new translation of the Bible; and they instead of
    obeying that counsel, had used their property for the purpose of
    building a {165} steam-mill and raising a hundred acres of hemp;
    and the Lord had not blessed them in the business, but sunk their
    hemp in the Mississippi river. I told him it was my opinion that
    Brother Law was the dough-head referred to.

    I have had no secret conversation whatever with the mayor, and
    never received any charge except the one, with the rest of the
    police, before the city council.

    The mayor suggested the propriety, since Rockwell and others are
    clear, and we have the promise of protection from the governor; and
    as the police are now well organized, that they put up their guns
    and that the council pass such an order. The Danite system alluded
    to by Norton never had any existence. It was a term made use of by
    some of the brethren in Far West, and grew out of an expression I
    made use of when the brethren were preparing to defend themselves
    from the Missouri mob, in reference to the stealing of Macaiah's
    images (Judges chapter 18)--If the enemy comes, the Danites will be
    after them, meaning the brethren in self-defense.

    The mayor instructed the police to lay up their arms till further
    orders.

    At half past four p.m. council adjourned.

[Sidenote: Reconciliation of the Prophet and Wm. Law.]

The council spent nearly the whole day in investigating the subject
and examining these two witnesses. The police were all sworn and
cross-examined by William Law and the aldermen, and the result showed
nothing but imagination, having grown out of the surmises of Daniel
Carn; upon which Law became satisfied, shook hands with me, declaring
he did not believe a word of the story, and said he would stand by me
to the death, and called the whole council and the police to witness
his declaration.

_Thursday 4.--_At home.

[Sidenote: Repartee of Joseph and Emma Smith]

I took dinner in the north room, and was remarking to Brother Phelps
what a kind, provident wife I had,--that when I wanted a little bread
and milk, she would load the table with so many good things, it would
destroy my appetite. At this moment Emma came in, while Phelps, in
continuation of the conversation said, "You must do as Bonaparte
did--have a little table, just large enough for the victuals you want
yourself." {166} Mrs. Smith replied, "Mr. Smith is a bigger man than
Bonaparte: he can never eat without his friends." I remarked, "That is
the wisest thing I ever heard you say."

_Friday 5.--_At home.

Last night I dreamed I saw two serpents swallowing each other tail
foremost.

[Sidenote: Alarm of William Marks.]

Another tempest in a tea-pot, or big fuss about nothing at all. In
consequence of the night being severely cold, some persons built a
fire on the bank of the river, nearly opposite William Marks' house.
He then became afraid, and concluded he must either be the Brutus or
the dough-head, and lay awake all night, thinking the police had built
the fire to kill him by! In the morning he called on me, reported the
circumstances and expressed his fears, when another session of inquiry
was held by the city council at his request, and the police sworn and
questioned. The following is a synopsis of the minutes:--

    _Special Session of the City Council--Fears of Wm. Law and Marks._

    [Sidenote: Friday, January 5, 1834, 11 a.m.]

    Names of members called.

    Prayer by O. Spencer.

    Minutes of the last two councils read and approved.

    Object of the council stated by the mayor, similar to the last
    council as William Law and William Marks had considered themselves
    in danger. When he heard the report he was unwilling to believe
    anything about it, from the course the thing took in the last
    council; but, for the sake of others, he had called this council.

    As Leonard Soby was going home night before last, he was hailed by
    a supposed policeman with a gun, which frightened him. Soby says
    that a policeman had told him that Marks and Law must not cross his
    tracks; that Warren Smith said at another time that William Marks
    and William Law were enemies to Joseph.

    I have never thought even to dream of doing anything against the
    peace of the inhabitants of this city. Did not know I had any
    enemies in this city: have stayed at home and heard but little: did
    not know that there was so much evil surmising among the people.
    My long forbearance to my enemies ought to be {167} sufficient
    testimony of my peaceful disposition toward all men. It occurred to
    my mind that it was not fear, but got up for effect; but I do not
    know it. I want the council to investigate this matter.

    _William Marks sworn._ Testified that on Monday evening Brother
    Soby came up and said, "Are you aware of the danger you are in?"
    Marks replied, "No."

    _Soby:_ "Your life is threatened; a policeman stopped me in the
    dark last night as I was going home; I was alarmed. I supposed
    the threats were from that policeman, but I was mistaken. Another
    policeman, Warren Smith, said last Sunday that Joseph had
    enemies--that Law and myself were Joseph's enemies, and if they
    came in his way they might be popped over. A fire was kindled in
    the street near my house, and I thought I was watched. Francis
    Higbee told me, and a man in the east part of the town told me; and
    a man came from the other side of the river and told the story to
    that man, as he said. Yesterday morning, Hyrum Smith, Wilson Law,
    and William Law met in the street, and I told the story as before
    related.

    _Mayor._ Did ever anybody tell you I directed you to be watched?

    _William Marks._ No.

    Marshal went for Francis M. Higbee and George W. Crouse.

    _Leonard Soby sworn._ On Sunday, 31st December last, I met Warren
    Smith in Crouse's store; asked him if he knew who the Brutus was.
    Warren Smith said he believed William Law was one, and Marks
    another; they had better not come in his way. Did not say he would
    shoot them, or endanger their life in any way. Did not know whether
    there were any private instructions, or not. Believed Brother Marks
    was in danger. Did not think Marks in any danger from Joseph.
    Thought Warren Smith was under a wrong impression with regard to
    Marks. Warren Smith said, "He, Marks, had better not cross my path
    when I am on duty." I gathered the idea there was something wrong
    with Brother Warren Smith. Do not recollect any person present.

    _Mayor._ Did Warren Smith or any other policeman give you to
    understand that I had authorized him to believe there was any
    difficulty between me and Brother Law or Marks?

    _Soby._ No. He did not think Warren Smith would transcend his
    official duties towards Law or Marks. Felt at the time Marks and
    Law were in danger. Did not think they were in danger, if they did
    out rise up against the authorities.

    Did not say he had any instruction. Said to Mr. Marks, "You have
    enemies." My impression was that somebody had been to Joseph to
    make a bad impression on his mind. Warren Smith did mention brother
    Marks' name, I think.

    {168} Thirty policemen, all who were present, sworn. Testified
    that General Smith had never given them any private instruction
    concerning the case before the council.

    Warren Smith said Soby asked his opinion who was the Judas. I
    said, from rumor, I would suspect William Law. Does not believe he
    mentioned Marks' name. My opinion was founded on rumor. Brother
    Isaac Hill said Brother Law was in a bad situation--was kicking,
    and if he did not mind, he would go over the board. If he had his
    property in available means and was away, he would feel better.
    Have heard it talked of that Brother Law was not going to stand. He
    did not tell what he was kicking at. I understand a Brutus to mean
    a treacherous man.

    _George W. Crouse sworn._ Does not recollect any conversation
    between Warren Smith and Leonard Soby, at his store, relative
    to the case in question. Had a discussion about the duties of
    policemen.

    Councilor John Taylor said it was customary in all cities for
    policemen to go armed in time of danger.

    Councilor Orson Hyde confirmed Councilor Taylor's observation.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith spoke. Told a story of the old Dutchman and
    the ox. Soby makes me think of an old Dutchman that had an ox--the
    first animal he ever owned in his life, and he broke him to ride;
    then he filled a sack with rocks and laid it on the ox's back, and
    got on himself, and told his son to hide by the roadside, and when
    he came along, to jump out and hollo boo, as he wanted to know
    how well his ox was broke. The son did accordingly. The ox was
    frightened, and threw the old man off. "Father," said the son, "I
    did as you told me." "Yes," said the old man; "but you made too big
    a boo."

    _Francis M. Higbee sworn._ Have received the impression from rumor
    that Mr. Law, Mr. Marks and probably one or two others, could
    not subscribe to all things in the Church, and there were some
    private matters that might make trouble. Don't know of anyone being
    in danger. No one told me the police had received any private
    instruction. Could not tell who he had received these rumors from.

    William Law spoke. Said he had no personal feeling against Warren
    Smith. Some two or three years since, he sued Brother Warren, and
    stayed the suit, &c. Was suspicious Warren Smith's feelings might
    have risen from that source.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith, Daniel Carn, Warren Smith, Leonard Soby, and
    William Marks addressed the council.

    The mayor spoke. Said no one had come to him with tales about
    William Marks, to prejudice his mind against him. Was totally
    ignorant of it. I said to Brother Dunham,--If any man approach
    {169} my house with arms, or attempted to disturb my house, I
    wanted the police to take care of that individual, whoever he might
    be. I repeat the instruction, and am perfectly astonished that
    Brother Law, Marks, or any other man should entertain such an idea
    [that they were in danger.] I live above suspicion on this subject
    from any source whatever. I never could bring my feelings to take
    revenge on my enemies. The City Council did not concoct the idea
    of having a police. The several wards petitioned for a police to
    protect them against invasion--wanted citizens to pass the streets
    at any time of night without molestation; but if the police see a
    man breaking in to my house or barn, or anybody's house or barn,
    tell him to stand, and inquire his business. I think it possible
    that some person has been practicing fraud on Brother Soby and the
    police and upon individuals, as the police, according to their
    instructions, had laid away their guns.

    Don't guard Brother Marks' house any more. Men must not pervert the
    power entrusted to them like ex-Governor Boggs, whose executive
    oath required him to protect the Saints in Missouri, but perverted
    his power to enforce their extermination from the State.

    Brother Soby does not know that it was a policeman who stopped him.
    Brother Marks does not know that the police kindled the fire before
    his house. Let the police have canes. Let the citizens pass and
    repass at all times of night.

    Councilor Taylor spoke. Thought the conclusion drawn up by Brother
    Soby, that Joseph or somebody was going to get revenged by setting
    the guard to kill Marks, was the most contemptible that could be
    imagined; and if Brother Soby had had the respect for Brother
    Joseph he ought to have had, he could not have formed such a
    conclusion.

    Mayor referred to Francis Higbee's testimony. Thought Francis
    Higbee had better stay at home and hold his tongue, lest rumor turn
    upon him and disclose some private matters which he would prefer
    kept hid. Did not believe there was any rumor of the kind afloat,
    or he could have told some of the names of his informants. Thought
    the young men of the city had better withdraw from his society, and
    let him stand on his own merits. I by no means consider him the
    standard of the city.

    There has been a system of corruption and debauchery, which these
    rumors have grown out of; and the individuals who are the authors
    of them are those who do not want a police: they want to prowl in
    the streets at pleasure without interruption.

    Alderman Orson Spencer spoke, approving the conduct of the police.

    General Wilson Law said. "I am Joseph's friend: he has no better
    {170} friend in the world: I am ready to lay down my life for him;"
    and upon that the mayor and General Wilson Law shook hands.

    The ordinance concerning the forty policemen read twice.

    The mayor objected to assuming the entire disposal of the police
    beyond the definition of the ordinance.

    Alderman George A. Smith said he could sleep with a fire near his
    house, if there were some of the police warming themselves by it;
    and he believed any honest man could do the same.

    The police received the thanks of the council.

    The cross-examination and speeches are generally omitted.

    Council adjourned at dusk for the want of candles.

[Sidenote: Reflections of the Prophet as to Traitors in High Places]

What can be the matter with these men? Is it that the wicked flee
when no man pursueth, that hit pigeons always flutter, that drowning
men catch at straws, or that Presidents Law and Marks are absolutely
traitors to the Church, that my remarks should produce such an
excitement in their minds. Can it be possible that the traitor whom
Porter Rockwell reports to me as being in correspondence with my
Missouri enemies, is one of my quorum? The people in the town were
astonished, almost every man saying to his neighbor, "Is it possible
that Brother Law or Brother Marks is a traitor, and would deliver
Brother Joseph into the hands of his enemies in Missouri?" If not, what
can be the meaning of all this? "The righteous are as bold as a lion."

A number of gentlemen boarding at my house conversed with me on
national affairs. I sent for Brother Phelps, who came and read my
letter to John C. Calhoun, with which they were highly edified.

Elder Brigham Young went to La Harpe for the purpose of instructing the
Saints.

Commenced snowing a little before sunset, and continued all night.

_Saturday, 6.--_Snow about four inches deep. I rode out with Emma in a
sleigh.

The Bishops and lesser Priesthood met at Henry W. Miller's hall.

{171} _Sunday, 7.--_At home in the morning. In the afternoon, rode out
to my farm, and preached in Brother Cornelius P. Lott's house.

The Twelve Apostles attended meetings and preached in different parts
of the city.

At six p.m. attended prayer-meeting with the quorum in the assembly
room. Law and Marks absent.

_Monday, 8.--_At home in the morning.

At eleven went to my office to investigate a difficulty between John D.
Parker and his wife. After laboring with them about two hours, brought
about a reconciliation.

I also had an interview with William Law in the streets.

My uncle, John Smith, from Macedonia, visited me.

Amos Fielding arrived from Liverpool.

_Tuesday, 9.--_At home.

I insert the following from the _Neighbor_, as a specimen of the
respect which the Carthage mob has for law or justice:

    DISGRACEFUL AFFAIR AT CARTHAGE--OFFICERS RESISTED.

    On Tuesday last Horace S. Eldredge, one of our county officers,
    went to Carthage for the purpose of arresting Milton Cook, on the
    charge of bastardy, and bringing him before R. D. Foster, justice
    of the peace of this county, before whom affidavit had been made
    to that effect. He found the accused in Bartlett's grocery,
    (Carthage,) and arrested him.

    Cook had a gun that he said he had loaded for the purpose, and
    would make a hole through the constable if he molested him, and
    swore he would not be taken.

    Harmon T. Wilson and others then stepped forward to his assistance,
    and said that they had sworn to stand by him, and that he should
    not go. He [Eldredge] then returned with his process to the justice
    of the peace, and told him what had occurred.

    Mr. R. D. Foster then summoned eleven men to go along with the
    constable and assist him in bringing the delinquent. They went out
    and drove to the grocery, where they expected to find him; but he
    was not there. They then went out for a short time, without making
    known their business, when they saw an armed force gathering.

    {172} They shortly afterwards returned to the grocery, and saw him
    there where he swore he would not be taken. There was also an armed
    force standing in the door, who also swore he should not be taken.

    The officer having the process, Mr. Markham and Mr. Eagle stepped
    forward and wished to reason the case with them, the officer at the
    same time demanding their assistance. They were met with an armed
    force of about twenty, four of whom stood in the doorway, two with
    guns and bayonets, and two with pistols.

    The two having the bayonets charged directly at Mr. Markham, and
    swore they would run him through, and rushed upon him with their
    bayonets. He, however, warded off their blows with his arm, and
    the bayonet glanced and struck Mr. John Eagle in the abdomen. The
    bayonet went through his clothes, scratched his body, and glanced
    off without doing any further injury, other than giving him a
    slight cut in the hand.

    Those having the pistols then attempted to shoot, when Mr. Markham
    seized the hand of one of them that held the pistol, and prevented
    him from firing. The other put his pistol to Mr. Eagle's breast,
    and swore he would shoot him.

    The company at that time used all their force, and crowded the
    officers and their assistants some distance back, and carried off
    and secreted the prisoner. The officer and his company then went to
    the tavern to stay all night.

    The next morning, about eight o'clock, the constable and Mr.
    Markham went to the grocery and searched, and Bartlett said that he
    was gone--that he had taken his horse and gone out of town.

    They then saw a company of men gathered at Harmon T. Wilson's
    store, armed with guns, bayonets, pistols, clubs, and other
    missiles. Mr. Markham went to the store, where he found the
    constable and the prisoner. There were fifty in and about the
    store, all armed.

    Mr. Eldredge then told the company present who he was, and demanded
    all in the house to assist in taking the prisoner, and then seized
    him. As soon as he laid hold of the prisoner, about six or eight
    men laid hold of the constable. Mr. Markham assisted the constable.
    When Mr. Markham had nearly succeeded in liberating the constable,
    a man who was called Dr. Morrison, drew his pistol and shot at
    Markham. The ball missed Markham, but came so near Mr. Coltrin's
    head, who was one of the assistants, as to graze his forehead.

    As there were only four of the assistants in the store, they were
    overpowered by superior numbers, and the prisoner was taken away
    from them.

    They saw that it would be impossible to take him without bloodshed,
    and consequently returned home. The parties engaged in this affray
    {173} swore that, regardless of all law, they would defend the
    prisoner, and he should not be taken.

    We have received the above particulars from Mr. Markham, and can
    consequently rely upon the correctness of the statement, as he is
    one of the parties mentioned. The woman who was _enciente,_ who
    made the affidavit, is not in the Church, neither is Mr. Eagle--the
    person who was struck with the bayonet. Mr. Eagle has gone to the
    governor to make complaint.

    We think that it is high time that prompt measures be taken to put
    a stop to such abominable outrages. If officers can be insulted in
    this manner and the law violated with impunity, we think that we
    shall speedily slide back into the barbarous ages.

    Some of our mobocratic friends who assembled at a mobocratic
    meeting some time ago in Carthage, were considerably chagrined at
    our terming them mobocrats. We wonder whether they now believe
    that they are, or not? If such proceedings as those are cherished,
    farewell to our Republican institutions! farewell to law, equity,
    and justice! and farewell to all those sacred ties that bind men to
    their fellowmen!

    We would here ask where the sheriff was. Why was he not applied to?
    We merely ask for information. We don't know that he was present
    or applied to. If he was, it certainly was his duty to see the law
    magnified.

_Wednesday 10.--_At home.

[Sidenote: John Smith, Uncle of the Prophet, Ordained a Patriarch.]

Ordained Uncle John Smith a patriarch. Enjoyed myself well in an
interview with the brethren and concluded to take a ride part way with
my uncle on his return to Macedonia.

In consequence of a visit from some gentlemen from Carthage, I called
the City Council together at seven p.m. I copy the minutes:--

    _Special Session of City Council; Complaints of Carthage Citizens
    Considered_.

    January 10, 1844, 7 p.m.

    Names of members called.

    The mayor said:--"Messrs. Backman, Hamilton, and Sherman, lawyers
    from Carthage, have called on me and told me that the occasion of
    the excitement at Carthage and the resistance to the law, in the
    case of the arrest of Cook, was the late ordinance of this council
    to prevent unlawful search or seizure of person or property by
    foreign {174} process in the city of Nauvoo; that they considered
    said ordinance was designed to hinder the execution of the statutes
    of Illinois within this city; consequently, they, the old citizens,
    felt disposed to stop the execution of processes issuing from the
    city precincts. They also raised objections against the process by
    Justice Foster for the apprehension of Cook, because it was made
    returnable to him alone, whereas they said the statute required it
    to be made returnable before himself or some other justice.

    I explained to them the nature and reason of the ordinance--that
    was to prevent kidnapping under the pretense of law or process,
    and to facilitate the apprehension of thieves, &c., in this city,
    by throwing all foreign processes into the hands of the marshal,
    who would be most likely to know the hiding-places of fugitives
    from justice, who might secrete themselves in our city; and said
    that if any wrong impression had gone abroad with regard to the
    motives of the council in passing said ordinance, I would call the
    council immediately, that they might have the opportunity of giving
    any explanation necessary, so that the public might understand the
    ordinance in its true light. I have therefore called the council
    accordingly. I also referred the lawyers from Carthage to the
    statute which requires all processes issued in cases of bastardy
    to be returnable alone to the justice issuing the same, which
    they doubted until showed them the law, when they looked a little
    crest-fallen and foolish."

    After deliberation, an additional section relative to the foregoing
    ordinance was read three times, and passed, by way of amendment:--

    "Section 3. Be it ordained by the city council of the city of
    Nauvoo, that nothing in the foregoing ordinance shall be so
    construed as to prevent, hinder, or thwart the designs of justice,
    or to retard the civil officers of the state or county in the
    discharge of their official duties, but to aid and assist them
    within the limits of this city.

    "Passed January 10, 1844.

had done.

[Sidenote: Complaints of F.M. Higbee against the Prophet.]

I received a long equivocating letter from Francis M. Higbee, charging
me with having slandered his character and demanding a public trial

At the same time, Constable Eldredge summoned me to attend a court as

testimony.

The Twelve Apostles wrote the following letter:--

    _Letter: The Twelve Apostles to the Saints at Morley
    Settlement--Material Help Asked for_.

    NAUVOO, January 15, 1844.

    _To President Isaac Morley and the Saints at Morley Settlement, the
    Twelve send greeting_:--

    BELOVED BRETHREN--While the work of the Lord is great and sought
    out by all them that have pleasure therein, the Lord of the
    vineyard has laid special charges upon some of His servants to
    execute; and while we are striving by all means to raise funds to
    hasten the Temple the approaching spring, we are not unmindful of
    the "History of the Church," the "Great Proclamation to the Kings
    of the Earth," and the "Memorials to Congress," &c., all of which
    are now before the Church, though their {177} progress is retarded
    for the want of the necessities of life, in the families of those
    who are employed in this business.

    Two or three clerks are necessarily employed, and that continually,
    by our Prophet, who cheerfully devote their time--not a _tenth,_
    but the _whole,_ to roll on these desirable objects; but their
    hands are palsied and their pens stayed, more or less. Therefore,
    with the approbation of our President, we again call on you, as
    those who have ever been ready to listen to the wants of the
    Church, that you would raise such collections of provisions as you
    may have at your disposal, and forward the same _without delay_ to
    us, for the special benefit of the clerks of President Smith or the
    Church. Asking no more, it is right they should not go hungry or
    naked.

    Do you ask what is wanting? We answer, Look to your own households,
    and say what it requires to make them comfortable, and you will
    know just what is wanting by these men. _Eatables of every kind,_
    and even soap to keep their hands clean, is scarce at Nauvoo, and
    it takes many lights to keep the pen in motion these long evenings.

    The President has plenty to do without supporting a number of
    clerks, whose business as deeply concerns every other individual in
    the Church as himself, although he has done it to a great extent
    and with great inconvenience; and we are confident that when you
    are made acquainted with the facts, you will be unwilling that
    _Joseph_ should _do all, and get all the blessing._ And as you
    shall continue your liberality in temporal things, God shall pour
    out upon your heads blessings spiritual and temporal; and _now_ is
    the time for _action_.

    All is peace at Nauvoo, and the last report from the Carthaginians
    was, they were beginning to think it was time to throw down their
    arms and attempt a compromise. But the "Mormons" can truly say they
    have had no quarrel with them. It has all been between the citizens
    and the law, their own officers being the executors thereof; and we
    feel disposed to let them fight it out among themselves, while we
    live in peace and laugh at their folly.

    With our prayers and blessings, we subscribe ourselves

    Your brethren in Christ Jesus.

    In behalf of the quorum,

    B. YOUNG, President.

    W. RICHARDS, Clerk.

At ten, a.m., Francis M. Higbee was brought up before the Municipal
Court, on complaint of Orson Pratt, for absenting himself from City
Council without leave, when summoned as a witness, and for slanderous
and abusive language towards one of the members of the Council.

The court adjourned, and the City Council commenced their session,
continuing till two o'clock, during which time a reconciliation took
place with Francis M. Higbee, who had written a slanderous letter
concerning me, and said many hard things, which he acknowledged; and I
forgave him. I went before the Council and stated that all difficulties
between me and F. M. Higbee were eternally buried, and I was to be his
friend for ever. To which F. M. Higbee replied, "I will be his friend
for ever, and his right-hand man."

A number of the brethren assembled and chopped up the firewood which
had been hauled to my house yesterday, and piled it up ready for use.

The following "Ordinance concerning the sale of Spirituous Liquors" was
passed by the City Council:

    _An Ordinance concerning the Sale of Spirituous Liquors_.

    Whereas, the use and sale of distilled and fermented liquors for
    all purposes of beverage and drink by persons in health are viewed
    by this City Council with unqualified disapprobation:

    Whereas, nevertheless the aforesaid liquors are considered highly
    beneficial for medical and mechanical purposes, and may be safely
    employed for such uses, under the counsel of discreet persons:
    Therefore,

    {179} Sect. 1. Be it ordained by the City Council of the city of
    Nauvoo, that the Mayor of this city is hereby authorized to sell
    said liquors in such quantities as he may deem expedient.

    Sect. 2. Be it further ordained, that other persons not exceeding
    one to each ward of the city, may also sell said liquors in like
    quantities for medical and mechanical purposes by obtaining a
    license of the Mayor of the city. The above ordinance to be in full
    force and effect immediately after its passage,--all ordinances to
    the contrary notwithstanding.

    Be it ordained by the City Council of the city of Nauvoo, that
    hereafter all persons subpoenaed and attending upon courts of trial
    as witnesses, or as jurors in civil cases, shall not be compelled
    to testify or be held in attendance either as witness or juror,

    "STANZAS"

    _On the Presentation of the Book of Mormon to Queen Victoria_.

    BY MISS E. R. SNOW.

    Before leaving London, Elder Lorenzo Snow presented to her Majesty
    Queen Victoria, and his Royal Highness Prince Albert, through
    the politeness of Sir Henry Wheatly, two neatly bound copies of
    the Book of Mormon, which had been donated by President Brigham
    Young, and left in the care of Elder Snow for that purpose; which
    circumstance suggested the following lines:--

  Of all the monarchs of the earth
     That wear the robes of royalty,
  She has inherited by birth
     The broadest wreath of majesty.
  {182} From her wide territorial wing
     The sun does not withdraw its light,
  While earth's diurnal motions bring
     To other nations day and night.

  All earthly thrones are tottering things,
     Where lights and shadows intervene;
  And regal honor often brings
     The scaffold or the guillotine.

  But still her sceptre is approved;
     All nations deck the wreath she wears:
  Yet, like the youth whom Jesus loved,
     One thing is lacking even there.

  But lo! a prize possessing more
     Of worth than gems with honor rife--
  A herald of salvation bore
     To her the words of endless life.

  That GIFT, however fools deride,
     Is worthy of her royal care:
  She'd better lay her crown aside
     Than spurn the light reflected there.

  Oh would she now her influence bend--,
     The influence of royalty,
  Messiah's kingdom to extend,
     And Zion's "nursing mother" be.

  Thus with the glory of her name
     Inscribed on Zion's lofty spire,
  She'd win a wreath of endless fame,
     To last when other wreaths expire.

  Though over millions called to reign--
     Herself a powerful nation's boast,
  'Twould be her everlasting gain
     To serve the King, the Lord of Hosts.

  For there are crowns and thrones on high,
     And kingdoms there to be conferred;
  There honors wait that never die;
     There fame's immortal trump is heard.

  {183} Truth echoes--'tis Jehovah's word;
     Let kings and queens and princes hear;
  In distant isles the sound is heard;
     Ye heavens rejoice! O earth, give ear!

  The time, the time is now at hand
     To give a glorious period birth:
  The son of God will take command
     And rule the nations of the earth.

    Nauvoo, Jan. 20, 1844.

_Sunday 21.--_Preached at the southeast corner of the temple to several
thousand people, although the weather was somewhat unpleasant. My
subject was the sealing of the hearts of the fathers to the children,
and the hearts of the children to the fathers.

[The following synopsis was reported by Elder Wilford Woodruff:]--

    _Discourse: The Sealing Power in the Priesthood_.

    When I consider the surrounding circumstances in which I am placed
    this day, standing in the open air with weak lungs, and somewhat
    out of health, I feel that I must have the prayers and faith of
    my brethren that God may strengthen me and pour out His special
    blessing upon me, if you get very much from me this day.

    There are many people assembled here to-day, and throughout the
    city, and from various parts of the world, who say that they have
    received to a certainty a portion of the knowledge from God, by
    revelation, in the way that He has ordained and pointed out.

    I shall take the broad ground, then, that we have received a
    portion of knowledge from God by immediate revelation, and from the
    same source we can receive all knowledge.

    What shall I talk about to-day? I know what Brother Cahoon wants
    me to speak about. He wants me to speak about the coming of Elijah
    in the last days. I can see it in his eye. I will speak upon that
    subject then.

    The Bible says, "I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the
    coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn
    the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the
    children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a
    curse."

    {184} Now, the word _turn_ here should be translated _bind_, or
    seal. But what is the object of this important mission? or how is
    it to be fulfilled? The keys are to be delivered, the spirit of
    Elijah is to come, the Gospel to be established, the Saints of God
    gathered, Zion built up, and the Saints to come up as saviors on
    Mount Zion.

    But how are they to become saviors on Mount Zion? By building
    their temples, erecting their baptismal fonts, and going forth and
    receiving all the ordinances, baptisms, confirmations, washings,
    anointings, ordinations and sealing powers upon their heads, in
    behalf of all their progenitors who are dead, and redeem them that
    they may come forth in the first resurrection and be exalted to
    thrones of glory with them; and herein is the chain that binds the
    hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the
    fathers, which fulfills the mission of Elijah. And I would to God
    that this temple was now done, that we might go into it, and go to
    work and improve our time, and make use of the seals while they are
    on earth.

    The Saints have not too much time to save and redeem their dead,
    and gather together their living relatives, that they may be saved
    also, before the earth will be smitten, and the consumption decreed
    falls upon the world.

    I would advise all the Saints to go to with their might and gather
    together all their living relatives to this place, that they may
    be sealed and saved, that they may be prepared against the day
    that the destroying angel goes forth; and if the whole Church
    should go to with all their might to save their dead, seal their
    posterity, and gather their living friends, and spend none of their
    time in behalf of the world, they would hardly get through before
    night would come, when no man can work; and my only trouble at the
    present time is concerning ourselves, that the Saints _will be
    divided, broken up, and scattered,_ before we get our salvation
    secure; for there are so many fools in the world for the devil to
    operate upon, it gives him the advantage oftentimes.

    The question is frequently asked "Can we not be saved without
    going through with all these ordinances, &c.?" I would answer,
    No, not the fullness of salvation. Jesus said, "There are many
    mansions in my Father's house, and I will go and prepare a place
    for you." _House_ here named should have been translated kingdom;
    and any person who is exalted to the highest mansion has to abide a
    celestial law, and the whole law too.

    But there has been a great difficulty in getting anything into the
    heads of this generation. It has been like splitting hemlock knots
    with a corn-dodger for a wedge, and a pumpkin for a beetle. Even
    the Saints are slow to understand.

    {185} I have tried for a number of years to get the minds of the
    Saints prepared to receive the things of God; but we frequently see
    some of them, after suffering all they have for the work of God,
    will fly to pieces like glass as soon as anything comes that is
    contrary to their traditions: they cannot stand the fire at all.
    How many will be able to abide a celestial law, and go through and
    receive their exaltation, I am unable to say, as many are called,
    but few are chosen.

_Tuesday. 23.--_Ebenezer Robinson took possession of the Nauvoo
Mansion, to continue it as a public-house. W. W. Phelps, Newel K.
Whitney and Willard Richards valued the printing office and lot at
$1,500; printing apparatus, $950; bindery, $112; foundry, $270; total,
$2,832. I having sold the concern to John Taylor, who in consideration
was to assume the responsibility of the Lawrence estate.

night was clear and cold.

The ship _Fanny,_ Captain Patterson, sailed from Liverpool with 210
Saints on board.

I insert the following from the _Millennial Star_:--

    _Importance of Elders Keeping Journals, Case of Healing Recorded_.

    MR. EDITOR:--The idea has frequently crossed my mind, that were the
    Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ in this age to keep a journal
    of their travels and ministry, and record all the healings and
    miracles they had witnessed from time to time,--that should their
    separate journals be afterwards collected together and published
    in a volume, I am inclined to believe that a far greater number of
    manifest displays of the power of God would be therein recorded
    than is found in the journals of the Elders of the Church of Jesus
    Christ in the early ages, at least so far as they are faithfully
    handed down to us in the New Testament Scriptures.

    And although, as in days of old, we are frequently branded with the
    epithets of "fools, fanatics, religious enthusiasts, dupes, and
    vile impostors," yet "what we have felt and seen, with confidence
    we tell."

    We have frequently heard from individuals on whose testimony we
    can rely with the greatest confidence, of extraordinary displays
    of the power of God in the gift of healing; such, for instance,
    as the blind receiving their sight, the deaf having their hearing
    restored, the lame man being made to "leap as an hart," the dumb
    spirit being cast out, and one instance of the dead being restored
    to life.

    Another instance of the kind last mentioned, with a heart
    overflowing with gratitude, I desire to record. On the afternoon of
    yesterday, a child of mine, a girl aged eight years, was sliding
    on the rails of the staircase, when on a sudden she turned over,
    and fell from top to bottom with a most tremendous crash, falling
    on her head, and being completely double when picked up by her
    mother,--so much so indeed, that {187} her brother, who heard
    the noise, looked out of the kitchen, and seeing something lying
    in the passage motionless, concluded that his sister had thrown
    some dirty linen over the rails, and took no further notice. Her
    mother, on hearing the noise occasioned by her fall, hastened out
    of the parlor to the fatal spot, and immediately discovered it
    was poor Mary Jane, who lay motionless, speechless, senseless,
    yea, lifeless. She instantly took her up in her arms, and when she
    beheld her appearance, in an agony she cried out, "My child is
    dead! she has fallen and killed herself."

    By this time I had hastened to the horrid scene, where I beheld
    my lovely girl stretched on the lap of her disconsolate mother,
    without the slightest appearance of life. I immediately examined
    her, and found that she breathed not, and that her pulsation
    had ceased. Her eyes also were wide open, and quite fixed as in
    death, and there appeared to be gathering over them the film of
    dissolution. In fact, if it be true that Eutychus (the young man
    mentioned in the 20th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, who fell
    from an upper story,) was taken up dead, it is equally true that my
    daughter was taken up dead, for there was not the slightest vestige
    of life apparent.

    At this moment, with heart uplifted to my Heavenly Father, I, in
    mighty faith, placed my hands upon her and ejaculated, "Lord,
    heal my child!" when in one moment she shewed signs of life, and
    attempted to speak.

    I immediately gave her to drink a little cold water, and bathed her
    head with the same. She then sat up and vomited considerably, and
    she is now so far recovered as this morning to sing a verse of a
    hymn and walk about as usual.

    During my presidency over the Liverpool Conference, which is nearly
    eighteen months, I have witnessed many cases of healing, but never
    any so very striking as the one I have just related.

    If you deem the narrative worthy of a place in your pages of the
    _Millennial Star,_ you are quite at liberty to insert it.

    I remain, dear brother,

    Yours sincerely in the Gospel of Jesus,

    GEORGE MITCHELSON.

[Sidenote: The Presidential Election Considered.]

_Monday, 29.--_At ten, a.m., the Twelve Apostles, together with Brother
Hyrum and John P. Greene, met at the mayor's office, to take into
consideration the proper course for this people to pursue in relation
to the coming Presidential election.

The candidates for the office of President of the United States at
present before the people are Martin Van Buren {188} and Henry Clay.
It is morally impossible for this people, in justice to themselves, to
vote for the re-election of President Van Buren--a man who criminally
neglected his duties as chief magistrate in the cold and unblushing
manner which he did, when appealed to for aid in the Missouri
difficulties. His heartless reply burns like a firebrand in the breast
of every true friend of liberty--"_Your cause is just, but I can do
nothing for you_."

As to Mr. Clay, his sentiments and cool contempt of the people's
rights are manifested in his reply--_"You had better go to Oregon for
redress,"_ which would prohibit any true lover of our constitutional
privileges from supporting him at the ballot-box.

It was therefore moved by Willard Richards, and voted unanimously--

That we will have an independent electoral ticket, and that Joseph
Smith be a candidate for the next Presidency; and that we use all
honorable means in our power to secure his election.

I said--

    _The Prophet on the Campaign_.

    If you attempt to accomplish this, you must send every man in
    the city who is able to speak in public throughout the land
    to electioneer and make stump speeches, advocate the "Mormon"
    religion, purity of elections, and call upon the people to stand by
    the law and put down mobocracy. David Yearsly must go,--Parley P.
    Pratt to New York, Erastus Snow to Vermont, and Sidney Rigdon to
    Pennsylvania.

    After the April Conference we will have General Conferences all
    over the nation, and I will attend as many as convenient. Tell the
    people we have had Whig and Democratic Presidents long enough:
    we want a President of the United States. If I ever get into the
    presidential chair, I will protect the people in their rights and
    liberties. I will not electioneer for myself. Hyrum, Brigham,
    Parley and Taylor must go. Clayton must go, or he will apostatize.
    The Whigs are striving for a king under the garb of Democracy.
    There is oratory enough in the Church to carry me into the
    presidential chair the first slide.

Captain White, of Quincy, was at the Mansion last night, {189} and this
morning drank a toast. * * * "May Nauvoo become the empire seat of
government!"

[Sidenote: Commencement of the Prophet's Views on Powers and Policy of
U.S.]

I dictated to Brother Phelps the head of my pamphlet, entitled, "Views
on the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States."

A Millerite lecturer came into the office with Brother Clayton, about
five, p.m. I had some conversation with him about the definition of the
Greek word Hades, and the Hebrew word Sheol, &c. He lectured in the
evening in the hall.

Prayer-meeting at Elder Brigham Young's.

Governor Ford wrote the following expostulatory epistle to the citizens
of Hancock County, through the _Warsaw Signal_:--

    _Governor Ford's Warning to the People of Hancock County_.

    SPRINGFIELD January 29, 1844.

    DEAR SIR:--I have received the copy of the proceeding and
    resolutions of a meeting of the citizens of Hancock County, which
    you did me the honor to send me.

    I have observed with regret that occasions have been presented for
    disturbing the peace of your county; and if I knew what I could
    legally do to apply a corrective, I would be very ready to do it.
    But if you are a lawyer, or at all conversant with the law, you
    will know that I, as a governor, have no right to interfere in your
    difficulties.

    As yet, I believe that there has been nothing like war among you:
    and I hope that all of you will have the good sense to see the
    necessity of preserving peace. If there is anything wrong in the
    Nauvoo charters, or in the mode of administering them, you will see
    that nothing short of legislative or judicial power is capable of
    enforcing a remedy.

    I myself had the honor of calling the attention of the Legislature
    to this subject at the last session; but a large majority of both
    political parties in that body either did not see the evil which
    you complain of, or, if they did, they repeatedly refused to
    correct it. And yet a call is made upon me to do that which all
    parties refused to do at the last session.

    I have also been called upon to take away the arms from the
    _Mormons,_ to raise the militia to arrest a supposed fugitive, and
    in fact to repeal some of the ordinances of the City of Nauvoo.

    Hancock County is justly famed for its intelligence; and I cannot
    {190} believe that any of its citizens are so ignorant as not to
    know that I have no power to do these things.

    The absurd and preposterous nature of these requests give some
    color to the charge that they are made for political effect only.
    I hope that this charge is untrue; for, in all candor, it would be
    more creditable to those concerned to have their errors attributed
    to ignorance than to a disposition to embroil the country in the
    horrors of war for the advancement of party ends.

    But if there should be any truth in the charge, (which God forbid.)
    I affectionately entreat all the good citizens engaged in it to
    lay aside their designs and yield up their ears to the voice of
    justice, reason, and humanity. All that I can do at present is to
    admonish both parties to beware of carrying matters to extremity.

    Let it come to this--let a state of war ensue, and I will be
    compelled to interfere with executive power. In that case also, I
    wish, in a friendly, affectionate, and candid manner, to tell the
    citizens of Hancock County, _Mormons_ and all, that my interference
    will be against those who shall be the first transgressors.

    I am bound by the laws and Constitution to regard you all as
    citizens of the State, possessed of equal rights and privileges,
    and to cherish the rights of one as dearly as the rights of
    another. I can know no distinction among you except that of
    assailant and assailed.

    I hope, dear sir, you will do me the favor to publish this letter
    in the papers of your county, for the satisfaction of all persons
    concerned.

    I am, with the highest respect,

    Your obedient servant,

    THOMAS FORD.

_Tuesday 30.--_At eleven, a.m., I went into the office with Colonel
Jackson.

[Sidenote: Winchester's Mission to Warsaw.]

_Wednesday, 31.--_Eleven, a.m., I called at the office, and told
Benjamin Winchester to go to Warsaw and preach the first principles of
the Gospel, get some lexicons, and return home.

{191} Prayer-meeting at Elder Brigham Young's in the evening. There
seems to be quite a revival throughout Nauvoo, and an inquiry after the
things of God, by all the quorums and the Church in general.

[Sidenote: Rigdon's Appeal to Pennsylvania.]

Sidney Rigdon published a lengthy appeal to the Legislature of the
State of Pennsylvania, setting forth in pathetic style the grievances
he had suffered through the persecution against the Church by the State
of Missouri, which concludes as follows:--

    _Peroration of Rigdon's Appeal to Pennsylvania_.

    In confidence of the purity and patriotism of the representatives
    of the people of his native state, your memorialist comes to your
    honorable body, through this his winged messenger, to tell you that
    the altar which was erected by the blood of your ancestors to civil
    and religious liberty, from whence ascended up the holy incense of
    pure patriotism and universal good will to man, into the presence
    of Jehovah, a savior of life, is thrown down, and the worshipers
    thereat have been driven away, or else they are lying slain at
    the place of the altar. He comes to tell your honorable body that
    the temple your fathers erected to freedom, whither their sons
    assembled to hear her precepts and cherish her doctrines in their
    hearts, has been desecrated--its portals closed, so that those who
    go up thither are forbidden to enter.

    He comes to tell your honorable body that the blood of the heroes
    and patriots of the revolution, who have been slain by wicked hands
    for enjoying their religious rights, the boon of Heaven to man, has
    cried and is crying in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, saying,
    "Redress, redress our wrongs, O Lord God of the whole earth."

    He comes to tell your honorable body that the dying groans of
    infant innocence and the shrieks of insulted and abused females,
    and many of them widows of revolutionary patriots, have ascended up
    into the ears of Omnipotence, and are registered in the archives
    of eternity, to be had in the day of retribution as a testimony
    against the whole nation, unless their cries and groans are heard
    by the representatives of the people, and ample redress made, as
    far as the nation can make it, or else the wrath of the almighty
    will come down in fury against the whole nation.

    Under all these circumstances, your memorialist prays to be heard
    {192} by your honorable body touching all the matters of his
    memorial. And as a memorial will be presented to Congress this
    session for redress of our grievances, he prays your honorable body
    will instruct the whole delegation of Pennsylvania, in both houses,
    to use all their influence in the national councils to have redress
    granted.

    And, as in duty bound, your memorialist will ever pray.

    SIDNEY RIGDON.

Miss E. R. Snow published the following apostrophe to--

    "MISSOURI."

    What aileth thee, O Missouri! that thy face should gather
    blackness? and why are thy features so terribly distorted?

    Rottennesss has seized upon thy vitals, corruption is preying upon
    thy inward parts, and the breath of thy lips is full of destructive
    contagion.

    What meaneth thy shaking? and why art thou terrified? Thou hast
    become like Belshazzar. "_Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin_!" is indeed
    written against thee; but it is the work of thine own hand;
    the characters upon thy wall are of thine own inscription; and
    wherefore dost thou tremble?

    Wouldst thou know the interpretation thereof? Hast thou sought for
    a Daniel to declare it unto thee? Verily one greater than a Daniel
    was in thy midst; but thou hast butchered the Saints, and hast
    hunted the Prophets like Ahab of old.

    Thou has extinguished the light of thy own glory; thou hast plucked
    from thy head the crown of honor; thou hast divested thyself of the
    robe of respectability; thou hast thrust from thine own bosom the
    veins that flowed with virtue and integrity.

    Thou hast violated the laws of our sacred constitution; thou hast
    unsheathed the sword against thy dearest national rights, by rising
    up against thine own citizens, and moistening thy soil with the
    blood of those that legally inherited it.

    When thou hadst torn from helpless innocence its rightful
    protectors thou didst pollute the holy sanctuary of female virtue,
    and barbarously trampled upon the most sacred gems of domestic
    felicity.

    Therefore the daughters of Columbia count thee a reproach, and
    blush with indignation at the mention of thy name.

    Thou hast become an ignominious stain on the escutcheon of a noble,
    free and independent republic; thou hast become a stink in the
    nostrils of the Goddess of Liberty.

    {193} Thou art fallen--thou art fallen beneath the weight of thine
    own unhallowed deeds, and thine iniquities are pressing as a heavy
    load upon thee.

    But although thy glory has departed--though thou hast gone down
    like a star that is set forever, thy memory will not be erased;
    thou wilt be had in remembrance even until the Saints of God shall
    forget that the way to the celestial kingdom is "through great
    tribulation."

    Though thou shouldst be severed from the body of the Union, like a
    mortified member--though the lion from the thicket should devour
    thee, thy doings will be perpetuated; mention will be made of them
    by the generations to come.

    Thou art already associated with Herod, Nero, and the bloody
    Inquisition; thy name has become synonymous with oppression,
    cruelty, treachery, and murder.

    Thou wilt rank high with the haters of righteousness and the
    shedders of innocent blood: the hosts of tyrants are waiting
    beneath to meet thee at thy coming.

    O ye wise legislators! ye executives of the nation! ye distributors
    of justice! ye advocates of equal rights! arise and redress the
    wrongs of an innocent people, and redeem the cause of insulted
    liberty.

    Let not the contagious spirit of corruption wither the sacred
    wreath that encircles you, and spread a cloud of darkness over the
    glory of your star-spangled banner;

    Lest the monarchs of the earth should have you in derision; lest
    you should be weighed in the balance with the heathen nations,
    and should be found wanting; lest the arm of the Lord should be
    revealed in judgment against you; lest an arrow of vengeance
    from the almighty should pierce the rotten fabric of a once
    sheltering constitution, and your boasted confidence become like
    an oak dismembered of its branches, whose shattered trunk is torn
    piecemeal by the uprising of the tempest!

    For the cries of the widow and fatherless, the groans of the
    oppressed and the prayers of the suffering exile have come up
    before the God of Hosts, who brought our pilgrim fathers across the
    boisterous ocean, and raised up a Washington to break the yoke of
    foreign oppression.

Phinehas Richards published a thrilling appeal to the inhabitants of

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which he is a member.

_Friday, 2.--_Dr. Willard Richards called and read Phinehas Richards'
appeal to the inhabitants of Massachusetts, for redress of Missouri
grievances.

Prayer-meeting at Elder Brigham Young's. Weather cold.

I went into the assembly room, where I found Elders Wilford Woodruff,
Willard Richards, and W. W. Phelps, to whom I related the following
dream, which Elder Willford Woodruff reported:

    _The Prophet's Dream--Troubled Waters Overcome_.

    I was standing on a peninsula, in the midst of a vast body of water
    where there appeared to be a large harbor or pier built out for
    boats to come to. I was surrounded by my friends, and while looking
    at this harbor I saw a steamboat approaching the harbor. There were
    bridges on the pier for persons to cross, and there came up a wind
    and drove the steamboat under one of the bridges and upset it.

    I ran up to the boat, expecting the persons would all drown; and
    wishing to do something to assist them, I put my hand against the
    side of the boat, and with one surge I shoved it under the bridge
    and righted it up, and then told them to take care of themselves.
    But it was not long before I saw them starting out into the channel
    or main body of the water again.

    The storms were raging and the waters rough. I said to my friends
    that if they did not understand the signs of the times and the
    spirit of prophecy, they would be apt to be lost.

    It was but a few moments after when we saw the waves break over the
    boat, and she soon foundered and went down with all on board.

    The storm and waters were still very rough; yet I told my friends
    around me that I believed I could stem those waves and that storm,
    and swim in the waters better than the steamboat did; at any rate I
    was determined to try it. But my friends laughed at me, and told me
    I could not stand at all, but would be drowned.

    {195} The waters looked clear and beautiful, though exceedingly
    rough; and I said I believed I could swim, and I would try it
    anyhow. They said I would drown. I said I would have a frolic in
    the water first, if I did; and I drove off in the raging waves.

    I had swam but a short distance when a towering wave overwhelmed
    me for a time; but I soon found myself on the top of it, and soon
    I met the second wave in the same way; and for a while I struggled
    hard to live in the midst of the storm and waves, and soon found I
    gained upon every wave, and skimmed the torrent better; and I soon
    had power to swim with my head out of water: so the waves did not
    break over me at all, and I found that I had swam a great distance;
    and in looking about, I saw my brother Samuel by my side.

    I asked him how he liked it. He said, "First rate," and I thought
    so too. I was soon enabled to swim with my head and shoulders out
    of water, and I could swim as fast as any steamboat.

    In a little time it became calm, and I could rush through the
    water, and only go in to my loins, and soon I only went in to my
    knees, and finally could tread on the top of the water, and went
    almost with the speed of an arrow.

    I said to Samuel, See how swift I can go! I thought it was great
    sport and pleasure to travel with such speed, and I awoke.

_Saturday 13.--_Prayer-meeting in the assembly room.

The High Council met. Did but little business.

A rather favorable article appears in Niles' _National Register_ of
this date, noticing the correspondence between myself and John C.
Calhoun, a copy of which is contained in the political department of
the same number.

It also notices the correspondence between myself and James Arlington
Bennett, publishing the same, with some of our city ordinances. The
editor also quotes the following from the _Hawk Eye_:--

    _Mormon Improvements._

    Although much complained has been made about the Mormons, we saw
    on our late trip evidences of improvement on our prairies which we
    consider highly creditable to the Mormons who made them, without
    whom we doubt whether they would have been made for many years to
    come. All those who have traveled over the large prairie between
    Fort Madison, Warsaw and Carthage, remember how dreary it was a few
    {196} years since. Now it is studded with houses and good farms.
    The English, who understand hedging and ditching far better than
    our people, have gone upon that prairie and have enclosed extensive
    fields in this manner. Along the old Rock Island tract, which we
    traveled seven years ago, and which was then a dreary waste, we
    saw a field enclosed with a good sod fence, six miles long and one
    wide. We think such enterprise is worthy to be mentioned. As long
    as the Mormons are harmless, and do not interfere with the rights
    of our people we think they should be treated well. We shall never
    convince them that they are a deluded people, as far as their
    religious notions are concerned, in any other way.

_Monday 5.--_The regular session of the Municipal Court was opened in

different wards in the city presented their tax-lists, which occupied
nearly all day. The court remitted the taxes of the widows and of the
poor who were unable to pay.

[Sidenote: Architecture of the Nauvoo Temple.]

In the afternoon, Elder William Weeks (whom I had employed as architect
of the Temple,) came in for instruction. I instructed him in relation
to the circular windows designed to light the offices in the dead
work of the arch between stories. He said that round windows in the
broad side of a building were a violation of all the known rules of
architecture, and contended that they should be semicircular--that the
{197} building was too low for round windows. I told him I would have
the circles, if he had to make the Temple ten feet higher than it was
originally calculated; that one light at the centre of each circular
window would be sufficient to light the whole room; that when the whole
building was thus illuminated, the effect would be remarkably grand. "I
wish you to carry out _my_ designs. I have seen in vision the splendid
appearance of that building illuminated, and will have it built
according to the pattern shown me."

Called at my office in the evening, and revised my "Views of the Powers
and Policy of the Government of the United States." I was the first one
who publicly proposed a national bank on the principles set forth in
that pamphlet.

_Tuesday, 6.--_Very cold day.

I spent the evening with my brother Hyrum, Sidney Rigdon, and the
Twelve Apostles and their wives, at Elder John Taylor's; took supper,
and had a very pleasant time.

_Wednesday, 7.--_An exceedingly cold day. In the evening I met with my
brother Hyrum and the Twelve Apostles in my office, at their request,
to devise means to promote the interests of the General Government.
I completed and signed my "Views of the Powers and Policy of the
Government of the United States," which I here insert:

    _Views of the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United
    States.--Joseph Smith._

    Born in a land of liberty, and breathing an air uncorrupted with
    the sirocco of barbarous climes, I ever feel a double anxiety for
    the happiness of all men, both in time and in eternity.

    My cogitations, like Daniel's have for a long time troubled me,
    when I viewed the condition of men throughout the world, and
    more especially in this boasted realm, where the Declaration of
    Independence "holds these truths to be self-evident, that all men
    are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
    certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and
    the pursuit of happiness;" but at the same time some two or three
    millions of people are held as slaves for life, because the spirit
    in them is covered with a darker skin than ours; and hundreds of
    our own kindred for an infraction, or supposed infraction, {198}
    of some over-wise statute, have to be incarcerated in dungeon
    gloom, or penitentiaries, while the duellist, the debauchee, and
    the defaulter for millions, and other criminals, take the uppermost
    rooms at feasts, or, like the bird of passage, find a more
    congenial clime by flight.

    The wisdom which ought to characterize the freest, wisest, and most
    noble nation of the nineteenth century, should, like the sun in
    his meridian splendor, warm every object beneath its rays; and the
    main efforts of her officers, who are nothing more nor less than
    the servants of the people, ought to be directed to ameliorate the
    condition of all, black or white, bond or free; for the best of
    books says, "God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to
    dwell on all the face of the earth."

    Our common country presents to all men the same advantages, the
    facilities, the same prospects, the same honors, and the same
    rewards; and without hypocrisy, the Constitution, when it says,
    "We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more
    perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility,
    provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and
    secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do
    ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of
    America," meant just what it said without reference to color or
    condition, _ad infinitum_.

    The aspirations and expectations of a virtuous people, environed
    with so wise, so liberal, so deep, so broad, and so high a
    charter of _equal rights_ as appears in said Constitution, ought
    to be treated by those to whom the administration of the laws is
    entrusted with as much sanctity as the prayers of the Saints are
    treated in heaven, that love, confidence, and union, like the sun,
    moon, and stars, should bear witness,

  "For ever singing as they shine,
  The hand that made us is divine!"

    Unity is power; and when I reflect on the importance of it to the
    stability of all governments, I am astounded at the silly moves of
    persons and parties to foment discord in order to ride into power
    on the current of popular excitement; nor am I less surprised at
    the stretches of power or restrictions of right which too often
    appear as acts of legislators to pave the way to some favorite
    political scheme as destitute of intrinsic merit as a wolf's heart
    is of the milk of human kindness. A Frenchman would say, _"Presque
    tout aimer richesses et pouvoir."_ (Almost all men like wealth and
    power.)

    I must dwell on this subject longer than others; for nearly one
    hundred years ago that golden patriot, Benjamin Franklin, drew
    up a plan of union for the then colonies of Great Britain, that_
    now_ are such {199} an independent nation, which, among many
    wise provisions for obedient children under their father's more
    rugged hand, had this:--"They have power to make laws, and lay
    and levy such general duties, imports, or taxes as to them shall
    appear most equal and just, (considering the ability and other
    circumstances of the inhabitants in the several colonies,) and such
    as may be collected with the least inconvenience to the people,
    rather discouraging luxury than loading industry with unnecessary
    burthens." Great Britain surely lacked the laudable humanity and
    fostering clemency to grant such a just plan of union; but the
    sentiment remains, like the land that honored its birth, as a
    pattern for wise men _to study the convenience of the people more
    than the comfort of the cabinet_.

    And one of the most noble fathers of our freedom and country's
    glory, great in war, great in peace, great in the estimation of the
    world, and great in the hearts of his countrymen, (the illustrious
    Washington,) said in his first inaugural address to Congress--"I
    behold the surest pledges that as, on one side, no local prejudices
    or attachments, no separate views or party animosities will
    misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch
    over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on
    another, that the foundations of our national policy will be laid
    in the pure and immutable principles of private morality, and
    the pre-eminence of free government be exemplified by all the
    attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command
    the respect of the world."

    Verily, here shine the virtue and wisdom of a statesman in such
    lucid rays, that had every succeeding Congress followed the
    rich instruction in all their deliberations and enactments,
    for the benefit and convenience of the whole community and the
    communities of which it is composed, no sound of a rebellion in
    South Carolina, no rupture in Rhode Island, no mob in Missouri
    expelling her citizens by Executive authority, corruption in
    the ballot-boxes, a border warfare between Ohio and Michigan,
    hard times and distress, outbreak upon outbreak in the principal
    cities, murder, robbery, and defalcation, scarcity of money, and
    a thousand other difficulties, would have torn asunder the bonds
    of the Union, destroyed the confidence of man with man, and left
    the great body of the people to mourn over misfortunes in poverty
    brought on by corrupt legislation in an hour of proud vanity for
    self-aggrandizement.

    The great Washington, soon after the foregoing faithful admonition
    for the common welfare of his nation, further advised Congress
    that "among the many interesting objects which will engage
    your attention, that of providing for the common defense will
    merit particular regard. To be prepared for war is one of the
    most effectual means of preserving peace." As the Italian would
    say--"_Buono aviso_."

    {200} The elder Adams, in his inaugural address, give national
    pride such a grand turn of justification, that every honest
    citizen must look back upon the infancy of the United States with
    an approving smile, and rejoice that patriotism in their rulers,
    virtue in the people, and prosperity in the Union once crowded the
    expectations of hope, unveiled the sophistry of the hypocrite,
    and silenced the folly of foes. Mr. Adams said, "If national
    pride is ever justifiable or excusable, it is when it springs not
    from _power_ or riches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of
    national innocence, information, and benevolence."

    There is no doubt such was actually the case with our young realm
    at the close of the last century. Peace, prosperity, and union
    filled the country with religious toleration, temporal enjoyment,
    and virtuous enterprise; and grandly, too, when the deadly winter
    of the "Stamp Act," the "Tea Act," and other close communion acts
    of Royalty had choked the growth of freedom of speech, liberty
    of the press, and liberty of conscience--did light, liberty, and
    loyalty flourish like the cedars of God.

    The respected and venerable Thomas Jefferson, in his inaugural
    address, made more than forty years ago, shows what a beautiful
    prospect an innocent, virtuous nation presents to the sage's eye,
    where there is space for enterprise, hands for industry, heads for
    heroes, and hearts for moral greatness. He said, "A rising nation
    spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing all the seas
    with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in commerce
    with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing rapidly
    to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye,--when I contemplate
    these transcendent objects, and see the honor, the happiness, and
    the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the
    auspices of this day. I shrink from the contemplation, and humble
    myself before the magnitude of the undertaking."

    Such a prospect was truly soul-stirring to a good man. But "since
    the fathers have fallen asleep," wicked and designing men have
    unrobed the Government of its glory; and the people, if not in
    dust and ashes, or in sackcloth, have to lament in poverty her
    departed greatness, while demagogues build fires in the north and
    south, east and west, to keep up their spirits _till it is better
    times._ But year after year has left the people to _hope_, till the
    very name of _Congress or State Legislature_ is as horrible to the
    sensitive friend of his country as the house of "Bluebard" is to
    children, or "Crockford's" Hell of London to meek men. [1]

    When the people are secure and their rights properly respected,
    then the four main pillars of prosperity--viz., agriculture,
    manufactures, {201} navigation, and commerce, need the fostering
    care of Government; and in so goodly a country as ours, where the
    soil, the climate, the rivers, the lakes, and the sea coast, the
    productions, the timber, the minerals, and the inhabitants are
    so diversified, that a pleasing variety accommodates all tastes,
    trades, and calculations, it certainly is the highest point of
    supervision to protect the whole northern and southern, eastern
    and western, centre and circumference of the realm, by a judicious
    tariff. It is an old saying and a true one, "If you wish to be
    _respected,_ respect yourselves."

    I will adopt in part the language of Mr. Madison's inaugural
    address,--"To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all
    nations, having correspondent dispositions; to maintain sincere
    neutrality towards belligerent nations; to prefer in all cases
    amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences
    to a decision of them by an appeal to arms; to exclude foreign
    intrigues and foreign partialities, so degrading to all countries,
    and so baneful to free ones; to foster a spirit of independence
    too just to invade the rights of others, too proud to surrender
    our own, too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices ourselves, and
    too elevated not to look down upon them in others; to hold the
    union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness;
    to support the Constitution, which is the cement of the Union,
    as well in its limitations as in its authorities; to respect the
    rights and authorities reserved to the States and to the people
    as equally incorporated with and essential to the success of the
    general system; to avoid the slightest interference with the rights
    of conscience or the functions of religion, so wisely exempted from
    civil jurisdiction; to preserve in their full energy the other
    salutary provisions in behalf of private and personal rights, and
    of the freedom of the press,--so far as intention aids in the
    fulfillment of duty, are consummations too big with benefits not to
    captivate the energies of all honest men to achieve them, when they
    can be brought to pass by reciprocation, friendly alliances, wise
    legislation, and honorable treaties."

    The Government has once flourished under the guidance of trusty
    servants; and the Hon. Mr. Monroe, in his day, while speaking of
    the Constitution, says, "Our commerce has been wisely regulated
    with foreign nations and between the States. New States have
    been admitted into our Union. Our Territory has been enlarged
    by fair and honorable treaty, and with great advantage to the
    original States; the States respectively protected by the national
    Government, under a mild paternal system against foreign dangers,
    and enjoying within their separate spheres, by a wise partition of
    power, a just proportion of the sovereignty, have improved their
    police, extended their settlements, and attained a strength and
    maturity which are the best proofs of {202} wholesome laws well
    administered. And if we look to the condition of individuals, what
    a proud spectacle does it exhibit! On whom has oppression fallen
    in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right
    of person or property?--who restrained from offering his vows in
    the mode which he prefers to the Divine Author of his being? It
    is well know that all these blessings have been enjoyed in their
    fullest extent; and I add, with peculiar satisfaction, that there
    has been no example of a capital punishment being inflicted on
    any one for the crime of high treason." What a delightful picture
    of power, policy, and prosperity! Truly the wise man's proverb is
    just--Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any
    people.

    But this is not all. The same honorable statesman, after having had
    about forty years' experience in the Government, under the full
    tide of successful experiment, gives the following commendatory
    assurance of the efficiency of the _Magna Charta_ to answer its
    great end and aim--_to protect the people in their rights._ "Such,
    then, is the happy Government under which we live; a Government
    adequate to every purpose for which the social compact is formed;
    a Government elective in all its branches, under which every
    citizen may by his merit obtain the highest trust recognized by the
    Constitution, which contains within it no cause of discord, none
    to put at variance one portion of the community with another, a
    Government which protects every citizen in the full enjoyment of
    his rights, and is able to protect the nation against injustice
    from foreign powers."

    Again, the younger Adams, in the silver age of our country's
    advancement to fame, in his inaugural address (1825), thus candidly
    declares the majesty of the youthful republic in its increasing
    greatness;--"The year of jubilee, since the first formation of our
    union, has just elapsed: that of the Declaration of Independence
    is at hand. The consummation of both was effected by this
    Constitution. Since that period, a population of four millions has
    multiplied to twelve. A Territory, bounded by the Mississippi, has
    been extended from sea to sea. New States have been admitted to the
    Union, in numbers nearly equal to those of the first confederation.
    Treaties of peace, amity, and commerce have been concluded with the
    principal dominions of the earth. The people of other nations, the
    inhabitants of regions acquired, not by conquest, but by compact,
    have been united with us in the participation of our rights and
    duties, of our burdens and blessings. The forest has fallen by the
    ax of our woodsman. The soil has been made to teem by the tillage
    of our farmers. Our commerce has whitened every ocean. The dominion
    of man over physical nature has been extended by the invention of
    our artists. Liberty and law have marched hand in hand. All the
    purposes of human association have been accomplished as effectively
    {203} as under any other Government on the globe, and at a cost
    little exceeding, in a whole generation, the expenditures of other
    nations in a single year."

    In continuation of such noble sentiments, General Jackson, upon
    his ascension to the great chair of the chief magistracy, said,
    "As long as our Government is administered for the good of the
    people, and is regulated by their will, as long as it secures to us
    the rights of person and property, liberty of conscience, and of
    the press, it will be worth defending; and so long as it is worth
    defending, a patriotic militia will cover it with an impenetrable
    _aegis_."

    General Jackson's administration may be denominated the _acme_ of
    American glory, liberty, and prosperity; for the national debt,
    which in 1815, on account of the late war, was $125,000,000, and
    being lessened gradually, was paid up in his golden day, and
    preparations were made to distribute the surplus revenue among the
    several States; and that august patriot, to use his own words in
    his farewell address, retired, leaving "a great people prosperous
    and happy, in the full enjoyment of liberty and peace, honored and
    respected by every nation of the world."

    At the age, then, of sixty years, our blooming Republic began to
    decline under the withering touch of Martin Van Buren! Disappointed
    ambition, thirst for power, pride, corruption, party spirit,
    faction, patronage, perquisites, fame, tangling alliances,
    priestcraft, and spiritual wickedness in _high places,_ stuck hands
    and revelled in midnight splendor.

    Trouble, vexation, perplexity, and contention, mingled with hope,
    fear, and murmuring, rumbled through the Union and agitated the
    whole nation, as would an earthquake at the centre of the earth,
    the world heaving the sea beyond its bounds and shaking the
    everlasting hills; so, in hopes of better times, while jealousy,
    hypocritical pretensions, and pompous ambition were luxuriating on
    the ill-gotten spoils of the people, they rose in their majesty
    like a tornado, and swept through the land, till General Harrison
    appeared as a star among the storm-clouds for better weather.

    The calm came, and the language of that venerable patriot, in
    his inaugural address, while descanting upon the merits of the
    Constitution and its framers, thus expressed himself:--"There were
    in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas
    of a simple representative Democracy or Republic. And knowing the
    tendency of power to increase itself, particularly when executed by
    a single individual, predictions were made that, at no very remote
    period, the Government would terminate in virtual monarchy.

    "It would not become me to say that the fears of these patriots
    have {204} been already realized. But as I sincerely believe that
    the tendency of measures and of men's opinions for some years past
    has been in that direction, it is, I conceive, strictly proper
    that I should take this occasion to repeat the assurances I have
    heretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that
    tendency, if it really exists, and restore the Government to its
    pristine health and vigor."

    This good man died before he had the opportunity of applying one
    balm to ease the pain of our groaning country, and I am willing
    the nation should be the judge, whether General Harrison, in his
    exalted station, upon the eve of his entrance into the world of
    spirits, told the truth, or not, with acting President Tyler's
    three years of perplexity, and pseudo-Whig-Democrat reign to heal
    the breaches or show the wounds, _secundum artem_.

    Subsequent events, all things considered, Van Buren's downfall,
    Harrison's exit, and Tyler's self-sufficient turn to the whole, go
    to show-- [2] * * * _certainly there is a God in heaven to reveal
    secrets_.

    No honest man can doubt for a moment but the glory of American
    liberty is on the wane, and that calamity and confusion will sooner
    or later destroy the peace of the people. Speculators will urge
    a national bank as a savior of credit and comfort. A hireling
    pseudo-priesthood will plausibly push abolition doctrines and
    doings and "human rights" into Congress, and into every other place
    where conquest smells of fame, or opposition swells to popularity.
    Democracy, Whiggery, and cliquery will attract their elements and
    foment divisions among the people, to accomplish fancied schemes
    and accumulate power, while poverty, driven to despair, like hunger
    forcing its way through a wall, will break through the statues of
    men to save life, and mend the breach in prison glooms.

    A still higher grade of what the "nobility of nations" call "great
    men" will dally with all rights in order to smuggle a fortune at
    "one fell swoop," mortgage Texas, possess Oregon, and claim all the
    unsettled regions of the world for hunting and trapping; and should
    an humble, honest man, red, black, or white, exhibit a better
    title, these gentry have only to clothe the judge with richer
    ermine, and spangle the lawyer's finger with finer rings, to have
    the judgment of his peers and the honor of his lords as a pattern
    of honesty, virtue, and humanity, while the motto hangs on his
    nation's escutcheon--"_Every man has his price_!"

    Now, O people! people! turn unto the Lord and live, and reform this
    nation. Frustrate the designs of wicked men. Reduce Congress at
    {205} least two-thirds. Two Senators from a State and two members
    to a million of population will do more business than the army that
    now occupy the halls of the national Legislature. Pay them two
    dollars and their board per diem (except Sundays.) That is more
    than the farmer gets, and he lives honestly. Curtail the officers
    of Government in pay, number, and power; for the Philistine lords
    have shorn our nation of its goodly locks in the lap of Delilah.

    Petition your State Legislatures to pardon every convict in their
    several penitentiaries, blessing them as they go, and saying to
    them, in the name of the Lord, _Go thy way, and sin no more_.

    Advise your legislators, when they make laws for larceny, burglary,
    or any felony, to make the penalty applicable to work upon roads,
    public works, or any place where the culprit can be taught more
    wisdom and more virtue, and become more enlightened. Rigor and
    seclusion will never do as much to reform the propensities of
    men as reason and friendship. Murder only can claim confinement
    or death. Let the penitentiaries be turned into seminaries of
    learning, where intelligence, like the angels of heaven, would
    banish such fragments of barbarism. Imprisonment for debt is a
    meaner practice than the savage tolerates, with all his ferocity.
    "_Amor vincit omnia_."

    Petition, also, ye goodly inhabitants of the slave States, your
    legislators to abolish slavery by the year 1850, or now, and save
    the abolitionist from reproach and ruin, infamy and shame.

    Pray Congress to pay every man a reasonable price for his slaves
    out of the surplus revenue arising from the sale of public lands,
    and from the deduction of pay from the members of Congress.

    Break off the shackles from the poor black man, and hire him to
    labor like other human beings; for "an hour of virtuous liberty on
    earth is worth a whole eternity of bondage." Abolish the practice
    in the army and navy of trying men by court-martial for desertion.
    If a soldier or marine runs away, send him his wages, with this
    instruction, that his country will never trust him again; he has
    forfeited his honor.

    Make honor the standard with all men. Be sure that good is rendered
    for evil in all cases; and the whole nation, like a kingdom of
    kings and priests, will rise up in righteousness, and be respected
    as wise and worthy on earth, and as just and holy for heaven, by
    Jehovah, the Author of perfection.

    More economy in the national and state governments would make less
    taxes among the people; more equality through the cities, towns and
    country, would make less distinction among the people; and more
    honesty and familiarity in societies would make less hypocrisy
    and flattery in all branches of the community; and open, frank,
    candid decorum to all men, in this boasted land of liberty, would
    beget esteem, {206} confidence, union, and love; and the neighbor
    from any state or from any country, of whatever color, clime or
    tongue, could rejoice when he put his foot on the sacred soil of
    freedom, and exclaim, The very name of _"American"_ is fraught
    with _"friendship!"_ Oh, then, create confidence, restore freedom,
    break down slavery, banish imprisonment for debt, and be in love,
    fellowship and peace with all the world! Remember that honesty is
    not subject to law. The law was made for transgressors. Wherefore a
    * * * * good name is better than riches.

    For the accommodation of the people in every state and territory,
    let Congress show their wisdom by granting a national bank, with
    branches in each State and Territory, where the capital stock shall
    be held by the nation for the Central bank, and by the states and
    territories for the branches; and whose officers and directors
    shall be elected yearly by the people, with wages at the rate of
    two dollars per day for services; which several banks shall never
    issue any more bills than the amount of capital stock in her vaults
    and the interest.

    The net gain of the Central bank shall be applied to the national
    revenue, and that of the branches to the states and territories'
    revenues. And the bills shall be par throughout the nation, which
    will mercifully cure that fatal disorder known in cities as
    _brokerage,_ and leave the people's money in their own pockets.

    Give every man his constitutional freedom and the president full
    power to send an army to suppress mobs, and the States authority
    to repeal and impugn that relic of folly which makes it necessary
    for the governor of a state to make the demand of the President for
    troops, in case of invasion or rebellion.

    The governor himself may be a mobber; and instead of being
    punished, as he should be, for murder or treason, he may destroy
    the very lives, rights, and property he should protect. Like the
    good Samaritan, send every lawyer as soon as he repents and obeys
    the ordinances of heaven, to preach the Gospel to the destitute,
    without purse or scrip, pouring in the oil and the wine. A learned
    Priesthood is certainly more honorable than _"an hireling clergy_."

    As to the contiguous territories to the United States, wisdom would
    direct no tangling alliance. Oregon belongs to this government
    honorably; and when we have the red man's consent, let the Union
    spread from the east to the west sea; and if Texas petitions
    Congress to be adopted among the sons of liberty, give her the
    right hand of fellowship, and refuse not the same friendly grip to
    Canada and Mexico. And when the right arm of freemen is stretched
    out in the character of a navy for the protection of rights,
    commerce, and honor, let the iron eyes of power watch from Maine
    to Mexico, and from California to Columbia. Thus may union be
    strengthened, and foreign speculation prevented from opposing
    broadside to broadside.

    {207} Seventy years have done much for this goodly land. They have
    burst the chains of oppression and monarchy, and multiplied its
    inhabitants from two to twenty millions, with a proportionate share
    of knowledge keen enough to circumnavigate the globe, draw the
    lightning from the clouds, and cope with all the crowned heads of
    the world.

    Then why--oh, why will a once flourishing people not arise,
    phoenix-like over the cinders of Martin Van Buren's power, and
    over the sinking fragments of smoking ruins of other catamount
    politicians, and over the windfalls of Benton, Calhoun, Clay,
    Wright, and a caravan of other equally unfortunate law doctors,
    and cheerfully help to spread a plaster and bind up the _burnt,
    bleeding wounds,_ of a sore but blessed country?

    The Southern people are hospitable and noble. They will help to
    rid so _free_ a country of every vestige of slavery, whenever they
    are assured of an equivalent for their property. The country will
    be full of money and confidence when a National Bank of twenty
    millions, and a State Bank in every state, with a million or more,
    gives a tone to monetary matters, and make a circulating medium as
    valuable in the purses of a whole community as in the coffers of a
    speculating banker or broker.

    The people may have faults, but they should never be trifled with.
    I think Mr. Pitt's quotation in the British Parliament of Mr.
    Prior's couplet for the husband and wife, to apply to the course
    which the King and ministry of England should pursue to the then
    colonies of the _now_ United States, might be a genuine rule of
    action for some of the _breath-made_ men in high places to use
    towards the posterity of this noble, daring people:--

  "Be to her faults a little blind;
  Be to her virtues very kind."

    We have had Democratic Presidents, Whig Presidents, a
    pseudo-Democratic-Whig President, and now it is time to have a
    _President of the United States;_ and let the people of the whole
    Union, like the inflexible Romans, whenever they find a _promise_
    made by a candidate that is not _practiced_ as an officer, hurl the
    miserable sycophant from his exaltation, as God did Nebuchadnezzar,
    to crop the grass of the field with a beast's heart among the
    cattle.

    Mr. Van Buren said, in his inaugural address, that he went in the
    Presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of
    every attempt, on the part of Congress, to abolish slavery in the
    District of Columbia, against the wishes of the slave-holding
    States, and also with a determination equally decided to resist the
    slightest interference with it in the States where it exists.

    Poor little Matty made this rhapsodical sweep with the fact before
    his eyes, that the State of New York, his native State, had
    abolished {208} slavery without a struggle or a groan. Great God,
    how independent! From henceforth slavery is tolerated where it
    exists, constitution or no constitution, people or no people, right
    or wrong_: Vox Matti! Vox Diaboli!_ And peradventure, his great
    "sub-treasury" scheme was a piece of the same mind. But the man and
    his measures have such a striking resemblance to the anecdote of
    the Welshman and his cart-tongue, that when the Constitution was
    so long that it allowed slavery at the capitol of a free people,
    it could not be cut off; but when it was so short that it needed
    a _sub-treasury_ to save the funds of the nation, it _could be
    spliced!_ Oh, granny, granny, what a long tail our puss has got.
    [3] * * * But his mighty whisk through the great national fire, for
    the presidential chestnuts, _burnt the locks of his glory with the
    blaze of his folly_!

    In the United States the people are the government, and their
    united voice is the only sovereign that should rule, the only
    power that should be obeyed, and the only gentlemen that should be
    honored at home and abroad, on the land and on the sea. Wherefore,
    were I the president of the United States, by the voice of a
    virtuous people, I would honor the old paths of the venerated
    fathers of freedom; I would walk in the tracks of the illustrious
    patriots who carried the ark of the Government upon their shoulders
    with an eye single to the glory of the people, and when that people
    petitioned to abolish slavery in the slave states, I would use all
    honorable means to have their prayers granted, and, give liberty
    to the captive by paying the Southern gentlemen a reasonable
    equivalent for his property, that the whole nation might be free
    indeed!

    When the people petitioned for a National Bank, I would use my
    best endeavors to have their prayers answered, and establish
    one on national principles to save taxes, and make them the
    controllers of its ways and means. And when the people petitioned
    to possess the territory of Oregon, or any other contiguous
    territory, I would lend the influence of a Chief Magistrate to
    grant so reasonable a request, that they might extend the mighty
    efforts and enterprise of a free people from the east to the west
    sea, and make the wilderness blossom as the rose. And when a
    neighboring realm petitioned to join the union of liberty's sons,
    my voice would be, _Come_--yea, come, Texas; come Mexico, come
    Canada; and come, all the world: let us be brethren, let us be
    one great family, and let there be a universal peace. Abolish the
    cruel custom of prisons (except certain cases), penitentiaries,
    court-martials for desertion; and let reason and friendship reign
    over the ruins of ignorance and barbarity; yea, I would, as the
    universal friend of man, open the prisons, open the eyes, open
    the ears, and open the hearts of all {209} people, to behold and
    enjoy freedom--unadulterated freedom; and God who once cleansed the
    violence of the earth with a flood, whose Son laid down His life
    for the salvation of all His Father gave him out of the world, and
    who has promised that He will come and purify the world again with
    fire in the last days, should be supplicated by me for the good of
    all people. With the highest esteem, I am a friend of virtue and of
    the people,

CHAPTER IX.

COMMENTS ON CANDIDACY OF JOSEPH SMITH FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES--TENDERS OF PEACE TO MISSOURI--PRELIMINARY STEPS TO WESTERN
MOVEMENT OF THE CHURCH--JAMES A. BENNETT AND VICE PRESIDENCY.

_Wednesday, February 7, 1844.--_A piece of doggerel appears in the
_Warsaw Message_ of this date, entitled "Buckeye's Lamentations for
the Want of More Wives," evidently the production of Wilson Law, and
breathing a very foul and malicious spirit.

_Thursday, 8.--_Held Mayor's court, and tried two negroes for
attempting to marry white women: fined one $25, and the other $5. In
the evening there was a political meeting in the assembly room, when
Brother Phelps publicly read for the first time my "Views of the Powers
and Policy of the General Government." I addressed the meeting as
follows:--

    _Views of the Prophet on His Candidacy for President of United
    States_.

    I would not have suffered my name to have been used by my friends
    on anywise as President of the United States, or candidate for
    that office, if I and my friends could have had the privilege of
    enjoying our religious and civil rights as American citizens,
    even those rights which the Constitution guarantees unto all her
    citizens alike. But this as a people we have been denied from the
    beginning. Persecution has rolled upon our heads from time to time,
    from portions of the United States, like peals of thunder, because
    of our religion; and no portion of the Government as yet has
    stepped forward for our relief. And in view of these things, I feel
    it to be my right and privilege to obtain what influence and power
    I can, lawfully, in the United States, for the {211} protection
    of injured innocence; and if I lose my life in a good cause I am
    willing to be sacrificed on the altar of virtue, righteousness
    and truth, in maintaining the laws and Constitution of the United
    States, if need be, for the general good of mankind.

I was followed by Elders Hyde an Taylor, and a unanimous vote was taken
to maintain my political views.

_Friday, 9--_Held Mayor's court in my dining-room on the case,
"Nauvoo _versus_ William Withers," for assault. Case withdrawn on my
recommendation.

This evening a public meeting was held. I extract from the _Neighbor_:--

    PUBLIC MEETING.

    On Friday, the 9th instant, a public meeting was held in the
    assembly room, at which a public address of General Joseph Smith's
    to the citizens of the United States was read by Judge Phelps.
    The address is certainly an able document, big with meaning and
    interest, clearly pointing out the way for the temporal salvation
    of this Union, showing what would be our best policy, pointing out
    the rocks and quick-sand where the political bark is in danger of
    being wrecked, an the way to escape it, and evincing a knowledge
    and foresight of our political economy worthy of the writer.

    Appropriate remarks were made by several gentlemen after the
    reading of the address.

_Saturday, 10.--_I instructed the marshal to inform Mr. Cole, who kept
a select school in the assembly room, that I must for the future have
that room for my own use.

Prayer-meeting in the assembly room. Prayed for Sister Richards and
others, who were sick.

A conference was held at Tuscaloosa County, Alabama: Elder John
Brown, president; and George W. Stewart, clerk. Three branches were
represented, containing nine elders, two priests, three teachers, three
deacons, and 123 members.

_Sunday, 11.--_Snow on the ground. Thaw commenced in the afternoon. I
was at home.

{212} _Monday, 12.--_I sat in the city council, and recommended the
repeal of the ordinances entitled "An extra ordinance for the extra
case of Joseph Smith," "An ordinance to prevent unlawful search or
seizure of persons or property, by foreign [1] process, in the city
of Nauvoo," and "An ordinance regulating the currency;" and they were
repealed accordingly. The Memorial to Congress, passed December 21,
1843, was again read, and signed by the councilors, aldermen, mayor,
recorder, and marshal.

I instructed Councilor Orson Pratt to call all the Illinois
representatives together, and tell them our sufferings have been such
that we must have that document passed, and we _will_ have it.

"You must go in for it. Go to John Quincy Adams and ask him to call the
delegates from Massachusetts separate from the Illinois delegation,
and demand the same. Go to Henry Clay and other prominent men. Call
public meetings in the city of Washington. Take the saloon, publish the
admittance so much per ticket, invite the members of both houses to
come and hear you, and roar upon them. You may take all my writings you
think anything of and read to them, &c., and you shall prosper in the
name of God. Amen."

The recorder presented the report of the attendance of the city
council, from which it appears that I have sat with them eleven
sessions, from the 14th of October, 1843, to the 16th of January, 1844,
inclusive.

Councilor Orson Pratt nominated George P. Stiles as councilor during
his absence, which was confirmed by the council.

I burned $81 of city scrip according to ordinance.

Thawing. Streets very dirty.

_Tuesday, 13.--_I was at home. Settled with Theodore Turley, and gave
him the deed of a lot.

Having received an invitation from Brother Joseph L. Heywood to visit
Quincy, I wrote him in reply:--

    {213} _Letter:--Joseph Smith to Joseph L. Heywood--Anent a visit to
    Quincy_.

    NAUVOO, February 13, 1844.

    DEAR BROTHER HEYWOOD,--I sit down at this time to acknowledge the
    receipt of, and reciprocate the friendly feelings manifest in
    yours of the 7th instant; and, although surrounded by a press of
    business, shall take pleasure in spending a few moments to reply.

    I would take the greatest pleasure imaginable in coming down to
    Quincy on a visit to see you and all my friends in your city,
    would business and circumstances permit; but it would be a matter
    of impossibility almost for me to leave home at the present time,
    in consequence of a multitude of business which I have daily to
    attend to. Moreover, wisdom and prudence seem to forbid my coming,
    on account of the bitter feeling which manifests itself in various
    places between this and Quincy,--not that I have any apprehensions
    for my personal safety; for the same kind hand which hath hitherto
    been my shield and support would save me from the power of my
    wicked persecutors; but something might grow out of it which would
    prompt my adversaries to get out another illegal writ, and would
    eventually, probably, cost me some three or four thousand dollars,
    as in other cases, and under which I have still to labor to
    disadvantage. Under these considerations, therefore, I am compelled
    to decline paying you a visit for the present. At the same time, in
    connection with Mrs. Smith, I tender my warmest acknowledgement for
    the invitation.

    I am pleased to hear of the prosperity of your branch, and hope it
    will continue; for, although I never feel to force my doctrine upon
    any person; I rejoice to see prejudice give way to truth, and the
    traditions of men dispersed by the pure principles of the Gospel of
    Jesus Christ.

    I should be please to have the privilege of forming an acquaintance
    with your partner, Mr. Kimball, and his lady; and should they ever
    come up this way, I hope they will call and see me.

    As respects things in Nauvoo, I have nothing to say but good.
    Although the mobocrats of this county breathe out their shame with
    a continual foam, and threaten extermination, &c., the citizens
    of Nauvoo are at peace; they fear no danger, for the report of
    mobs has become so common, that the "Mormons" pay no attention to
    it whatever. Each man minds his own business, and all are making
    improvements as fast as they can. In fact, things in general seem
    prosperous and pleasing; and I never saw a better feeling amongst
    the Saints than at the present time.

    My family have been somewhat sick of late, and continue so,
    especially my youngest boy.

    {214} Accept, dear sir, the warmest respects of myself and Mrs.
    Smith, and please present the same to your lady. In the meantime I
    remain your friend and brother,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

President Brigham Young returned from Bear creek settlements, where he
had been preaching for the last few days.

_Wednesday, 14.--_At home through the day. In the evening the assembly
room was filled by the brethren, when my "Views of the Powers and
Policy of the Government of the United States" was again read. I
afterwards spoke on the same subject at a considerable length.

_Thursday, 15.--_At home. A beautiful day.

I insert the following article from the _Times and Seasons_:--

    WHO SHALL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT?

    This is an inquiry which to us as a people is a matter of the most
    paramount importance, and requires our most serious, calm, and
    dispassionate reflection. Executive power, when correctly wielded,
    is a great blessing to the people of this great commonwealth, and
    forms one of the firmest pillars of our confederation. It watches
    the interests of the whole community with a fatherly care; it
    wisely balances the other legislative powers when over-heated by
    party spirit or sectional feeling; it watches with jealous care our
    interests and commerce with foreign nations, and gives tone and
    efficacy to legislative enactments.

    The President stands at the head of these United States, and is the
    mouth-piece of this vast republic. If he be a man of an enlightened
    mind and a capacious soul,--if he be a virtuous man, a statesman,
    a patriot, and a man of unflinching integrity,--if he possess
    the same spirit that fired the souls of our venerable sires, who
    founded this great commonwealth, and wishes to promote the good
    of the whole republic, he may indeed be made a blessing to the
    community.

    But if he prostrates his high and honorable calling to base and
    unworthy purposes,--if he make use of the power which the people
    have placed in his hands for their interests to gratify his
    ambition, for the purpose of self-aggrandizement or pecuniary
    interest,--if he meanly pander with demagogues, loses sight of the
    interest of the nation, and {215} sacrifice the Union on the altar
    of sectional interests or party views, he renders himself unworthy
    of the dignified trust reposed in him, debases the nation in the
    eyes of the civilized world, and produces misery and confusion at
    home. "When the wicked rule, the people mourn."

    There is perhaps no body of people in the United States who
    are at the present time more interested about the issue of the
    presidential contest than are the Latter-day Saints. And our
    situation in regard to the two great political parties is a most
    novel one. It is a fact well understood that we have suffered great
    injustice from the State of Missouri, that we have petitioned to
    the authorities of that state for redress in vain, that we have
    also memorialized Congress under the late administration, and have
    obtained the heartless reply that "Congress has no power to redress
    your grievances."

    After having taken all the legal and constitutional steps that
    we can, we are still groaning under accumulated wrongs. Is there
    no power anywhere to redress our grievances? Missouri lacks the
    disposition and Congress lacks both the disposition and power (?);
    and thus fifteen thousand inhabitants of these United States can
    with impunity be dispossessed of their property; have their houses
    burned, their property confiscated, many of their numbers murdered,
    and the remainder driven from their homes and left to wander as
    exiles in this boasted land of freedom and equal rights; and after
    appealing again and again to the legally-constituted authorities of
    our land for redress, we are coolly told by our highest tribunals,
    "We can do nothing for you."

    We have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars into the coffers
    of Congress for their lands, and they stand virtually pledged to
    defend us in our rights, but they have not done it. If a man steals
    a dollar from his neighbor, or steals a horse or a hog, he [the
    neighbor] can obtain redress; but we have been robbed by wholesale,
    the most daring murders have been committed, and we are coolly
    told that we can obtain no redress. If a steamboat is set on fire
    on our coast by foreigners, even when she is engaged in aiding
    and abetting the enemies of that power, it becomes a matter of
    national interference and legislation; or if a foreigner, as in the
    case of McLeod, is taken on our land and tried for supposed crimes
    committed by him against our citizens, his nation interferes,
    and it becomes a matter of negotiation and legislation. But our
    authorities can calmly look on and see the citizens of a county
    butchered with impunity: they can see two counties dispossessed
    of their inhabitants, their houses burned, and their property
    confiscated; and when the cries of fifteen thousand men women and
    children salute their ears, they deliberately tell us that we can
    obtain no redress.

    Hear it, therefore, ye mobbers! Proclaim it to all the scoundrels
    in {216} the Union! Let a standard be erected around which shall
    rally all the renegades of the land: assemble yourselves and rob at
    pleasure; murder till you are satiated with blood; drive men, women
    and children from their homes: there is no law to protect them, and
    Congress has no power to redress their grievances; and the great
    father of the Union (the President) has not got an ear to listen to
    their complaints.

    What shall we do under this state of things? In the event of either
    of the prominent candidates, Van Buren or Clay, obtaining the
    presidential chair, we should not be placed in any better situation.

    In speaking of Mr. Clay, his politics are diametrically opposed to
    ours. He inclines strongly to the old school of Federalists, and
    as a matter of course would not favor our cause, neither could we
    conscientiously vote for him. And we have yet stronger objections
    to Mr. Van Buren on other grounds. He has sung the old song of
    Congress--"Congress has no power to redress your grievances."

    But did the matter rest here, it would not be so bad. He was in
    the presidential chair at the time of our former difficulties. We
    appealed to him on that occasion, but we appealed in vain, and his
    sentiments are yet _unchanged_.

    But all these things are tolerable in comparison to what we have
    yet to state. We have been informed from a respectable source that
    there is an understanding between Mr. Benton, of Missouri, and Mr.
    Van Buren, and a conditional compact entered into, that if Mr.
    Benton will use his influence to get Mr. Van Buren elected, Van
    Buren when elected, shall use his executive influence to wipe away
    the stain from Missouri by a further persecution of the "Mormons,"
    and wreaking out vengeance on their heads, either by extermination
    or by some other summary process. We could scarcely credit the
    statement; and we hope yet, for the sake of humanity, that the
    suggestion is false: but we have too good reason to believe that we
    are correctly informed.

    If, then, this is the case, can we conscientiously vote for a man
    of this description, and put the weapons into his hands to cut our
    throat with? We cannot. And however much we might wish to sustain
    the Democratic nomination, we cannot--we will not vote for Van
    Buren. Our interests, our property, our lives, and the lives of our
    families are too dear to us to be sacrificed at the shrine of party
    spirit and to gratify party feelings. We have been sold once in the
    State of Missouri, and our liberties bartered away by political
    demagogues, through executive intrigue, and we wish not to be
    betrayed again by Benton and Van Buren.

    Under these circumstances, the question again arises, Whom shall
    we support? GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH--a man of sterling worth and
    integrity and of enlarged views--a man who has raised himself
    from {217} the humblest walks in life to stand at the head of a
    large, intelligent, respectable, and increasing society, that has
    spread not only in this land, but in distant nations,--a man whose
    talents and genius are of an exalted nature, and whose experience
    has rendered him in every way adequate to the onerous duty.
    Honorable, fearless, and energetic, he would administer justice
    with an impartial hand, and magnify and dignify the office of Chief
    Magistrate of this land; and we feel assured that there is not a
    man in the United States more competent for the task.

    One great reason that we have for pursuing our present course is,
    that at every election we have been made a political target for
    the filthy demagogues in the country to shoot their loathsome
    arrows at. And every story has been put into requisition to blast
    our fame from the old fabrication of "walk on the water" down to
    "the murder of ex-Governor Boggs." The journals have teemed with
    this filthy trash, and even men who ought to have more respect
    for themselves--men contending for the gubernatorial chair have
    made use of terms so degrading, so mean, so humiliating, that a
    Billingsgate fisherwoman would have considered herself disgraced
    with. We refuse any longer to be thus bedaubed for either party.
    We tell all such to let their filth flow in its own legitimate
    channel, for we are sick of the loathsome smell.

    Gentlemen, we are not going either to "murder ex-Governor Boggs,
    nor a Mormon in this state for not giving us his money," nor are we
    going to "walk on the water," "nor drown a woman," nor "defraud the
    poor of their property," nor send "destroying angels after General
    Bennett to kill him," nor "marry spiritual wives," nor commit any
    other outrageous act this election to help any party with. You must
    get some other persons to perform these kind offices for you for
    the future. We withdraw.

    Under existing circumstances, we have no other alternative; and
    if we can accomplish our object, well: if not, we shall have the
    satisfaction of knowing that we have acted conscientiously, and
    have used our best judgment. And if we have to throw away our
    votes, we had better do so upon a worthy rather than upon an
    unworthy individual, who might make use of the weapon we put in his
    hand to destroy us with.

    Whatever may be the opinions of men in general in regard to Mr.
    Smith, we know that he needs only to be known to be admired; and
    that it is the principles of honor, integrity, patriotism, and
    philanthropy that have elevated him in the minds of his friends;
    and the same principles, if seen and known, would beget the esteem
    and confidence of all the patriotic and virtuous throughout the
    Union.

    Whatever, therefore, be the opinions of other men, our course is
    marked out, and our motto henceforth will be--_General Joseph
    Smith_.

{218} _Friday, 16.--_At home. This evening I spent two hours in the
office. Settled with Brother Whitney; gave him deed of several town
lots, and took his receipt in full.

_Saturday, 17.--_I wrote the following article:--

    PACIFIC INUENDO.

    The very candid, pacific, and highly creditable _advice_ which
    Governor Ford has done himself the honor to address to "the
    citizens of Hancock county, Mormons and all," and which appears
    in the _Warsaw Signal_ of the 14th instant, is like the balm of
    Gilead, well calculated to ease the pain which has troubled the
    heads and hearts of the Carthaginians, Warsawvians, and other
    over-jealous bodies for _weal and woe_.

    It certainly must be admitted, on all hands, that Governor Ford
    has exalted himself as a mediator, patriot, lawyer, governor,
    peacemaker, and friend of all, not only to magnify the law and make
    it honorable, but also in pointing out the part of peace.

    Such is what the Latter-day Saints have ever sought at the hands of
    those in authority; and with an approving conscience clear as the
    crystal spring, and with a laudable intention warm as the summer
    zephyr, and with a charitable prayer mellow as the morning dew, it
    is now our highest consolation to hope that all difficulties will
    cease, and give way to reason, sense, peace, and goodwill.

    The Saints, if they will be humble and wise, can now practice what
    they preach, and soften by good examples, rather than harden by a
    distant course of conduct, the hearts of the people.

    For general information, it may be well to say that there has
    never been any cause for alarm as to the Latter-day Saints. The
    legislature of Illinois granted a liberal charter for the City of
    Nauvoo; and let every honest man in the Union who has any knowledge
    of her say whether she has not flourished beyond the most sanguine
    anticipations of all. And while they witness her growing glory,
    let them solemnly testify whether Nauvoo has willfully injured the
    country, county, or a single individual one cent.

    With the strictest scrutiny publish the facts, whether a particle
    of law has been evaded or broken: virtue and innocence need no
    artificial covering. Political views and party distinctions never
    should disturb the harmony of society; and when the whole truth
    comes before a virtuous people, we are willing to abide the issue.

    We will here refer to the three last dismissals upon writs
    of _habeas corpus,_ of Joseph Smith, when arrested under the
    requisitions of Missouri.

    The first, in June, 1841, was tried at Monmouth, before Judge
    Douglas, of the fifth judicial circuit: and as no exceptions have
    been {219} taken to that decision by the state of Missouri--but
    Missouri previously entered a _nolle prosequi_ on all the old
    indictments against the Mormons in the difficulties of 1838--it is
    taken and granted that decision was just!

    The second, in December, 1842, was tried at Springfield before
    Judge Pope in the U. S. District Court; and from that honorable
    discharge, as no exceptions from any source have been made to those
    proceedings, it follows as a matter of course that that decision
    was just!

    And the third, in July, 1843, was tried at the city of Nauvoo,
    before the Municipal Court of said city; and as no exceptions to
    that discharge have been taken, and as the governor says there is
    "evidence on the other side to show that the sheriff of Lee county
    _voluntarily_ carried Mr. Reynolds (who had Mr. Smith in custody,)
    to the city of Nauvoo without any coercion on the part of any one,"
    it must be admitted that that decision was just!

    But is any man unconvinced of the justness of these strictures
    relative to the two last cases, let the astounding fact go forth,
    that _Orrin Porter Rockwell,_ whom Boggs swore was the principal in
    his [attempted] assassination, and as accessory to which Mr. Smith
    was arrested, has returned home, "clear of sin." In fact, there was
    not a witness to get up an indictment against him.

    The Messrs. Averys, who were unlawfully transported out of this
    state, have returned to their families in peace; and there seems to
    be no ground for contention, no cause for jealousy, and no excuse
    for a surmise that any man, woman, or child will suffer the least
    inconvenience from General Smith, the charter of Nauvoo, the city
    of Nauvoo, or even any of her citizens.

    There is nothing for a bone of contention! Even those ordinances
    which appeared to excite the feeling of some people have recently
    been repealed; so that if the "intelligent" inhabitants of Hancock
    county want peace, want to abide by the Governor's advice, want to
    have a character at home, and really mean to follow the Savior's
    golden rule, "To do unto others as they would wish others to do
    unto them," they will be still now, and let their own works praise
    them in the gates of justice and in the eyes of the surrounding
    world. Wise men ought to have understanding enough to conquer men
    with kindness.

    "A soft answer turneth away wrath," says the wise man; and it
    will be greatly to the credit of the Latter-day Saints to show
    the love of God, by now kindly treating those who may have, in an
    unconscious moment, done wrong; for truly said Jesus, Pray for
    thine enemies.

    Humanity towards all, reason and refinement to enforce virtue, and
    good for evil are so eminently designed to cure more disorders of
    society than an appeal to arms, or even argument untempered with
    friendship, {220} and the one thing needful that no vision for the
    future, guide-board for the distant, or expositor for the present,
    need trouble any one with what he ought to do.

    His own good, his family's good, his neighbor's good, his country's
    good, and all good seem to whisper to every person--The governor
    has told you what to do. Now do it.

    The constitution expects every man to do his duty; and when he
    fails the law urges him; or should he do too much, the same master
    rebukes him.

    Should reason, liberty, law, light, and philanthropy now guide the
    destinies of Hancock county with as much sincerity as has been
    manifested for her notoriety or welfare, there can be no doubt that
    peace, prosperity, and happiness will prevail, and that future
    generations as well as the present one will call Governor Ford _a
    peacemaker._ The Latter-day Saints will, at all events, and profit
    by the instruction, and call upon honest men to help them cherish
    all the love, all the friendship, all the courtesy, all the kindly
    feelings, and all the generosity that ought to characterize clever
    people in a clever neighborhood, and leave candid men to judge
    which tree exhibits the best fruit--the one with the most clubs and
    sticks thrown into its boughs and the grass trodden down under it,
    or the one with no sticks in it, some dead limbs, and rank grass
    growing under it; for by their signs ye can know their fruit, and
    by the fruit ye know the trees.

    Our motto, then, is Peace with all! If we have joy in the love of
    God, let us try to give a reason of that joy, which all the world
    cannot gainsay or resist. And may be, like as when Paul started
    with recommendations to Damascus to persecute the Saints, some one
    who has raised his hand against us with letters to men in high
    places may see a light at noonday, above the brightness of the sun,
    and hear the voice of Jesus saying, "It is hard for thee to kick
    against the pricks."

    Intelligence is sometimes the messenger of safety. And, willing to
    aid the governor in his laudable endeavors to cultivate peace and
    honor the laws, believing that very few of the citizens of Hancock
    county will be found in the negative of such a goodly course, and
    considering his views a kind of manifesto, or olive leaf, which
    shows that there is rest for the soles of the Saints' feet we give
    it a place in the _Neighbor,_ wishing it God speed, and saying,
    God bless good men and good measures! And as Nauvoo has been, so
    it will continue to be, a good city, affording a good market to
    a good country; and let those who do not mean to try the way of
    transgressors, say "Amen."

The High Council met and settled several cases of difficulty betwixt
brethren.

[Sidenote: Anti-Mormon Convention at Carthage.]

{221} The Anti-Mormons held a convention at Carthage, the object being
to devise ways and means of expelling the Saints from the State. Among
other resolutions was one appointing the 9th of March next as the day
of fasting and prayer, wherein the pious of all orders are requested
to pray to Almighty God that He would speedily bring the false Prophet
Joseph Smith to deep repentance, or that He will make a public example
of him and his leading accomplices.

The ice broke up in the river.

_Sunday, 18.--_Beautiful day. Southwest wind.

A very large assembly of the Saints met at the stand, near the Temple,
when I preached a lengthy discourse.

Four p.m., went to my office with Hyrum and two gentlemen from St.
Louis. Heard Dr. Richards read my correspondence with Senator Calhoun,
and Phelps read my "Views of the Power and Policy of the General
Government."

At seven, attended prayer-meeting in the assembly room.

_Monday, 19.--_At nine a.m. went to my office with Dr. Bernhisel, who
proposed some alterations in my views of the government. Phelps read
the same, and the doctor seemed better pleased with it than before.

    _To the Editor of the Neighbor_:--

    SIR,--I wish to say to you, as there seems to be a prospect of
    peace, that it will be more love-like, more God-like, and man-like,
    to say nothing about the _Warsaw Signal_.

    If the editor breathes out that old sulphurous blast, let him go
    and besmear his reputation and the reputation of those that uphold
    him with soot and dirt, but as for us and all honest men, we will
    act well our part, for there the honor lies.

    We will honor the advice of Governor Ford, cultivate peace and
    friendship with all, mind our own business, and come off with
    flying colors, respected, because, in respecting others, we respect
    ourselves.

    Respectfully, I am

    JOSEPH SMITH.

A conference was held in Halifax, Halifax county, {222} Nova Scotia,
Elder Robert Dickson, president. Two branches were represented,
consisting of thirty members, three elders, one priest, one teacher,
and two deacons.

The wild geese commenced flying north.

[Sidenote: Delegation from Lyman Wight on Indian Affairs.]

_Tuesday, 20.--_At ten a.m. went to my office, where the Twelve
Apostles and some others met in council with Brothers Mitchell Curtis
and Stephen Curtis who left the pinery on Black River, 1st January.
They were sent by Lyman Wight and Bishop Miller to know whether Lyman
should preach to the Indians, the Menominees and Chippeways having
requested it.

The Chippeways had given Brother Wight some wampum as a token of peace,
and the brethren had given them half a barrel of flour and an ox to
keep the Indians from starving, and Wight had gone through to Green Bay
with them to make a road.

I told them to tell Brother Wight I had no counsel to give him on
the subject. He is there on his own ground and must act on his own
responsibility, and do what he thinks best in relation to the Indians,
understanding the laws and nature of the subject as well as I can here,
and he shall never be brought into difficulty about it by us.

[Sidenote: Western Movement for the Church Contemplated]

I instructed the Twelve Apostles to send out a delegation and
investigate the locations of California and Oregon, and hunt out a good
location, where we can remove to after the temple is completed, and
where we can build a city in a day, and have a government of our own,
get up into the mountains, where the devil cannot dig us out, and live
in a healthful climate, where we can live as old as we have a mind to.

Warm. The ice floating down the river.

[Sidenote: A Wolf Hunt Called for Hancock Co.]

A meeting of the citizens of Hancock county was held at the court-house
in Carthage. Passed a resolution that the second Saturday of March be
appointed for a general wolf-hunt, being the same day {223} selected by
the convention of the 17th instant for a day of fasting and prayer for
my destruction.

[Sidenote: The Prophet on the Necessity of Complete Obedience to God.]

_Wednesday 21.--_The Rev. Mr. De Wolfe, Episcopalian, lectured in the
assembly room in the evening. I attended and, after the sermon, at his
request, spoke to the people, showing them that to get salvation we
must not only do some things, but everything which God has commanded.
Men may preach and practice everything except those things which God
commands us to do, and will be damned at last. We may tithe mint and
rue, and all manner of herbs, and still not obey the commandments of
God. The object with me is to obey and teach others to obey God in
just what He tells us to do. It mattereth not whether the principle is
popular or unpopular, I will always maintain a true principle, even if
I stand alone in it.

My _Pacific Inuendo_, written on the 17th instant, appeared in the
_Neighbor_ of to-day, in connection with Governor Ford's letter of the
29th of January.

Ice left the west bank of the river, opposite the lower brick house.

Very warm and pleasant.

Council of the Twelve met in my office. I insert the minutes:--

    _Minutes of a Council Meeting of the Twelve_.

    At a meeting of the Twelve, at the mayor's office, Nauvoo, February
    21, 1844, seven o'clock, p.m., Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt,
    Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith,
    Willard Richards and four others being present, called by previous

    and California, and select a site for a new city for the Saints.

    Jonathan Dunham, Phineas H. Young, David D. Yearsley, and David
    Fullmer, volunteered to go; and Alphonzo Young, James Emmett,
    George D. Watt, and Daniel Spencer were requested to go.

    Voted the above persons to be notified to meet with the council on
    Friday evening next, at the assembly room,

    WILLARD RICHARDS, Clerk.

{224} _Thursday, 22.--_At home.

Ice continues to run in the river. Very pleasant, cool nights.

_Friday, 23.--_W. W. Phelps received a letter from John Whitmer in
relation to certain records, and a book containing some of the early
history of the Church which had been written by my clerks, and was
Church property, and which had been fraudulently detained from my
possession by John Whitmer; to which Dr. Richards replied.

[Sidenote: The Western Exploring Equipment.]

Met with the Twelve in the assembly room concerning the Oregon and
California Exploring Expedition; Hyrum and Sidney present. I told them
I wanted an exploration of all that mountain country. Perhaps it would
be best to go direct to Santa Fe. "Send twenty-five men: let them
preach the Gospel wherever they go. Let that man go that can raise
$500, a good horse and mule, a double barrel gun, one-barrel rifle,
and the other smooth bore, a saddle and bridle, a pair of revolving
pistols, bowie-knife, and a good sabre. Appoint a leader, and let them
beat up for volunteers. I want every man that goes to be a king and a
priest. When he gets on the mountains he may want to talk with his God;
when with the savage nations have power to govern, &c. If we don't get
volunteers, wait till after the election."

George D. Watt said, "Gentlemen, I shall go." Samuel Bent, Joseph A.
Kelting, David Fullmer, James Emmett, Daniel Spencer, Samuel Rolfe,
Daniel Avery, and Samuel W. Richards, volunteered to go.

_Saturday, 24.--_At home. Had an interview with Brother Phelps at nine
o'clock.

Seth Palmer, Amos Fielding, Charles Shumway, and John S. Fullmer
volunteered to go to Oregon and California.

Fifteen hundred copies of my "Views" out of press.

Very pleasant the past two weeks; the pleasantest February I ever saw.

{225} President Brigham Young went to Knowlton's settlement on Bear
creek, and preached.

_Sunday, 25.--_I preached at the temple block. Hyrum also preached.

[Sidenote: A Prophecy of Deliverance of the Saints]

Evening, I attended prayer-meeting in the assembly room, We prayed that
"General Joseph Smith's Views of the Powers and Policy of the United
States," might be spread far and wide, and be the means of opening
the hearts of the people. I gave some important instructions, and
prophesied that within five years we should be out of the power of our
old enemies, whether they were apostates or of the world; and told the
brethren to record it, that when it comes to pass they need not say
they had forgotten the saying.

Some rain in the evening; cloudy and foggy.

_Monday, 26.--_At home. A cold wind from the north. Rainy, dull day.

[Sidenote: The Case of Botswick Slander of Hyrum Smith.]

In the afternoon, held court at the Mansion. City of Nauvoo _versus_
Orsimus F. Botswick, on complaint of Hyrum Smith for slanderous
language concerning him and certain females of Nauvoo. Botswick was
fined $50 and costs. Francis M. Higbee, his attorney, gave notice he
should appeal to the municipal court, and then to the circuit court. I
told Higbee what I thought of him for trying to carry such a suit to
Carthage--it was to stir up the mob and bring them upon us.

Prayer-meeting in the assembly room in the afternoon. My uncle John
Smith and lady were present, were anointed, and received blessings; and
in the evening Father Morley was also blessed.

Ira S. Miles volunteered to join the mountain exploring expedition.

In the afternoon, visited the printing office.

Mailed my "Views of Powers and Policy," &c., to the {226} President
and cabinet, supreme judges, senators, representatives, principal
newspapers in the United States, (all the German), and many postmasters
and individuals.

Almon L. Fullmer and Hosea Stout volunteered to go on the Western
Exploring Expedition.

_Wednesday, 28.--_At home. Rainy day.

At four, p.m., steamboat _General Brooke_ passed up the river: first
boat this season. No ice in sight.

In the evening I sent Brother Coolidge to Brother Phelps, to call the
brethren and pray for Brother Coolidge's sick child, as he thought it
could not live till morning. Elder John Taylor and others prayed for
him.

Dr. Alphonzo Young published an appeal to his native state of
Tennessee, giving a history of our Missouri troubles, and asking the
influence of that state to obtain redress.

The _Neighbor_ of to-day publishes the following:--

    FOR PRESIDENT, JOSEPH SMITH.

    Having now raised the name of our General and Prophet to the
    head of our columns, it becomes us, as Latter day Saints, to be
    prudent and energetic in the cause that we pursue, and not let any
    secondary influences control our minds or govern our proceedings.

    The step that we have taken is a bold one, and requires our united
    efforts, perseverance, and diligence; but important as it may be,
    it is no greater than others have taken, and they have conceived
    that they had a right, without molestation, to pursue that course,
    and to vote for that man whose election they in their wisdom
    thought would be most conducive to the public weal.

    As American citizens, then we presume that all will concede to us
    this right; and whatever may be their views respecting the policy
    of such a step, they will acknowledge that we act legally, justly,
    and constitutionally in pursuing our present course.

    Some have nominated Henry Clay, some Colonel Johnson, others John
    C. Calhoun, others Daniel Webster, and others Martin Van Buren.

    Those several committees, unquestionably thought that they had
    each of them made the wisest selection in naming the man of their
    choice. They selected their several candidates because they
    thought they were the wisest, the greatest statesmen, and the
    most competent to {227} fill the presidential chair, whilst they
    severally thought that the other candidates were incompetent.

    We have governed by the same principles; and if others think they
    have made the wisest selection, so do we. If others think they
    have nominated the greatest statesman, so do we; and while those
    several committees think that none of the nominations made are so
    good as their own, we think that the man of our choice is the most
    able, the most competent, the best qualified, and would fill the
    Presidential chair with greater dignity to the nation; and that his
    election would be conducive of more happiness and prosperity at
    home and abroad than that of any other man in these United States.

    This is a thing that we, as Latter-day Saints, know; and it now
    devolves upon us as an imperative duty to make others acquainted
    with the same things, and to use all our influence at home and
    abroad for the accomplishment of this object.

    Mr. Smith is not so generally known personally as are several of
    the above-named candidates; and although he has been much spoken of
    as a man, he has been a great deal calumniated and misrepresented,
    and his true character is very little known.

    It is for us to take away this false coloring; and by lecturing,
    by publishing, and circulating his works, his political views, his
    honor, integrity and virtue, to stop the foul mouth of slander, and
    present him before the public in his own colors, that he may be
    known, respected, and supported.

Thomas S. Edwards volunteered to join the exploring expedition to the
Rocky Mountains.

[Sidenote: A Reply Sketched to Cassius M. Clay.]

_Thursday, 29.--_Called at my office, and gave Brother Phelps the
_Zanesville Gazette_ of January 31, containing the speech of Cassius
M. Clay, delivered in Scott county, Kentucky, December 30, 1843, on
annexing Texas to the United States; and instructed him to reply to the
same, and gave him the subject matter, and directed the manner I wished
it done; and then rode out with Porter Rockwell.

The steamer _Ohio_ went up the river.

Moses Smith and Rufus Beach volunteered to join the Oregon exploring
expedition.

_Friday, March 1.--_Very frosty night; showery day, west wind.

Spent the day in counseling.

{228} Letters from the elders show a rapid progress of the work of the
Lord in different parts of the Union. Elder John E. Page has gone to
Washington for the purpose of proclaiming to the rulers of our nation
the principles of eternal truth. By a letter received from him, we
learn he has been preaching and baptizing in Boston and vicinity.

    _The High Council to the Saints in Nauvoo_.

    _The High Council of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints at Nauvoo to the Saints of this [Nauvoo] Stake, greeting_.

    BELOVED BRETHREN,--Realizing as we do, the importance of the work
    in which we are engaged, we deem it expedient to lay before you
    such matters from time to time as in our opinion will be beneficial
    to the Saints, and the spirit in us may seem to require.

    We would remind our brethren, the elders, who have at sundry times
    been sent forth as flaming heralds, messengers of the everlasting
    Gospel, who proclaim a message of salvation to their fellow-men,
    thereby gathering and bringing up to Zion the scattered elect of
    God, to be taught more perfectly he principles of salvation; that
    whilst their message is abroad we have had our mission to remain
    at Nauvoo and to participate with the Saints in the blessing of
    poverty, if such it may be called; amid sickness and distress, in
    the vexations and turmoils of the unruly and ungodly, for which
    no man has paid us, for days, weeks, months, and years; that our
    time has been spent in endeavoring to settle difficulties, set in
    order the things needful to salvation; in trying to reconcile and
    cement the feelings of our brethren to each other in the spirit of
    the Gospel; whilst at times, circumstances of a more painful nature
    have been presented.

    Individuals have been brought before us charged with high crimes in
    violation of the laws of heaven, on whom much patient exertion in
    the labors of love have by us been bestowed, to reclaim them from
    the error and evil of their doings.

    We regret to have it to say that in some instances our efforts have
    been fruitless; for after we have found in them an obstinate and
    unyielding spirit to the principles of right, we have (reluctantly)
    been compelled to sever them from the Church as withered branches.

    Such persons not unfrequently manifest their wickedness by their
    trifling with and bidding defiance to all and every good rule,
    regulation and law, set forth for the guidance of all Saints.

    One single trait of their depravity is frequently manifested by
    their going to some ignorant elder and getting re-baptized into the
    Church, {229} not having first made the least satisfaction (as was
    required) to such as they have injured.

    We have to say that baptism in such cases is not valid and cannot
    profit. We here continue to say; let such expelled person first be
    reconciled to his injured brother, and bring forth fruit mete for
    repentance; or, in case of dissatisfaction with our decision, take
    an appeal and reverse it, if found wrong.

    Expelled persons not complying with these rules (which are in
    accordance with the order of heaven), whom we have been once
    necessitated to withdraw fellowship from, cannot be restored in any
    illegal way; and we would say that all such clandestine entering
    into the Church is climbing up some other way, and that such
    persons can only be considered as thieves and robbers. We would
    also remind the elders that it is improper for them to re-baptize
    any such expelled persons while they remain thus obstinate; and
    that it will subject them to censure, and bring them to trial
    before a proper tribunal of the Church.

    We therefore hope, for the future, that certain officious,
    forward-feeling elders will be more prudent in such cases hereafter.

    We remain yours in the bonds of the new and everlasting covenant,

_Monday, 4.--_I suggested the name of James Arlington Bennett, of Long
Island, as a candidate for Vice-President.

At early candle-light, the First Presidency, Twelve Apostles, temple
committee, and others, met in council.

I insert the minutes.

    _Minutes of a Council Meeting--Twelve and Temple Committee_.

    George Coray came in, and said he was sent by Lyman Wight to get
    sheep, &c, to carry to the Pine country, to receipt for them, or
    agree to pay lumber.

    President Joseph suggested that it was best to let the Nauvoo House
    remain as it is until the temple is completed, as we need the
    temple more than anything else.

    Elder Haws said there was some dissatisfaction about being sent
    from the Pinery without accounts, &c., and could not have credit on
    tithing, and one month at the Pinery is only called fifteen days
    here.

    President Joseph told them that they should have their number of
    days in full. "We will let the Nauvoo house stand until the temple
    is done, and we will put all our forces on the Temple, turn our
    lumber towards the Temple, and cover it in this fall, and sell the
    remainder to get blasting powder, fuse, rope, steel, &c."

    And when the temple is completed, no man shall pass the threshold
    till he has paid five dollars; and every stranger shall pay five
    dollars towards liquidating the cash debts on the Temple, and I
    will not have the house dirtied.

    Let Woodworth go to the pinery, take the things wanted, and bring
    back the lumber, and his wages go on as usual.

    Let a special conference be called on the 6th of April, and all
    the elders called home who can come. Let the people of this city
    come together on Thursday, at nine o'clock in the morning. After
    two or three lectures, we will call on the people to fill up the
    boxes with liberal contributions, to procure cash materials for the
    temple.

I instructed a letter to be written to James Arlington {231} Bennett to
consult him on the subject of nominating him for Vice-President. I here
insert the letter:--

    _Letter--Willard Richards to James Arlington Bennett--The Matter of
    Bennett Becoming Candidate for Vice-President of U. S_.

    NAUVOO, March 4, 1844.

    DEAR GENERAL,--Yours of the 1st of February, was duly received, and
    produced the most pleasing sensations among your friends here, and
    especially with the Prophet, who said, "Tell General Bennett I am
    perfectly satisfied with his explanation; and as to _temper,_ I had
    not even thought of it."

    You suggest that Brother Joseph's correspondence with Mr. Calhoun
    would appear in some degree to contradict the noble sentiments
    expressed in that able document to yourself; but if you will notice
    that his communication to you was written as an individual, and
    that to Mr. Calhoun as the voice of the people he represents,
    I think you will discover no discrepancy; but if so, tell me
    particulars without delay, and you shall have an explanation.

    I have recently mailed to you General Smith's "Views of the
    Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States," which
    were drawn forth in consequence of his friends selecting him as
    a candidate for the next Presidency, which he very reluctantly
    acquiesced in, and it seems would not, only to support a favorite
    maxim_--"The people must govern;"_ but having once been prevailed
    upon to suffer his name to go abroad as a candidate, it is
    desirable to him of course, as to every patriot, that those who
    have brought him forward should use all honorable means to sustain
    him in the canvass; and if I had not felt disposed to uphold him
    before the people, I never would have been the first to urge
    his nomination; and during the short space since his name has
    been published, his friends have been astonished at the flood of
    influence that is rolling through the Western States in his favor,
    and in many instances where we might have least expected it.

    I need not assert what the wisest of the wise admit without
    argument--that General Smith is the greatest statesman of the
    19th century. Then why should not the nation secure to themselves
    his superior talents, that they may rise higher and higher in the
    estimation of the crowned heads of the nations and exalt themselves
    through his wisdom?

    Your friends here consider your letter about the Governorship of
    Illinois just like every man in your quarter, mere sport, child's
    sport; for who would stoop to the play of a single State, when the
    whole nation was on the board?--a cheaper game!

    General Smith says, if he must be President, Arlington Bennett
    must be Vice-President. To this his friends are agreed--agreed in
    everything; and in this consists our power: consequently, your
    name will {232} appear in our next paper as our candidate for
    Vice-President of the United States. You will receive our undivided
    support, and we expect the same in return for General Smith for
    the Presidency; and we will go it with the rush of a whirlwind, so
    peaceful, so gentle, that it will not be felt by the nation till
    the battle is won.

    Dear General, if glory, honor, force, and power in righteous
    principles are desired by you, now is your time. You are safe in
    following the counsel of that man who holds communion with heaven;
    and I assure you, if you act well your part, victory's the prize.

    Brother Arlington, look well to "General Smith's Views," and his
    letter to Calhoun, and comprehend him fully. Say to the _New York
    Herald,_ now is the time for your exaltation; raise your standard
    high, sound your trumpet long and loud, support General Smith and
    myself at the next election; and when we are exalted, you shall not
    be forgotten.

    Hold forth no false shadows to honest men; yet though there is but
    one best piece to the fatted calf, yet there are many good slices;
    therefore you will not forget the _"Advertiser," "Niles Register,"
    "Globe,"_ &c., &c.

    Get up an electoral ticket--New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
    any other state within your reach. Open your mouth wide, and God
    shall fill it. Cut your quill, and the ink shall flow freely.

    Commence at your own mansion and stay not, only for electioneering
    purposes, till by some popular route you reach Nauvoo; and if you
    preach Mormonism it will help you. At every stage, tavern, boat and
    company, expose the wickedness of Martinism in saying, if he is
    elected President, he will annihilate the Mormons, and proclaim the
    sycophancy of the candidates generally, and uphold Joseph against
    every aspersion and you shall triumph gloriously.

    We have many things to say to you, which we must keep till we see
    you face to face.

    All is right at Nauvoo. We are now fitting out a noble company to
    explore Oregon and California, and progressing rapidly with the
    great Temple, which we expect to roof this season, though there
    is yet a chance at the _eleventh hour_ for you to bring in your
    thousand, and secure your "penny."

    On the 6th of April is our special conference at Nauvoo. I wish you
    could be here on that occasion, but the time is too short. From
    that period our Elders will go forth by hundreds or thousands and
    search the land, preaching religion and politics; and if God goes
    with them, who can withstand their influence?

    My words are the words of your friends here--Come and see us. {233}
    Brother Joseph's, Young's, and Bernhisel's respects to you. Mrs.
    Richards' kind respects with mine to yourself and love to all yours.

    Most respectfully yours,

    WILLARD RICHARDS.

CHAPTER X.

URGING THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE--TENDERS OF PEACE TO
MISSOURI--PROPHET'S DISCOURSE ON ELIAS, ELIJAH, MESSIAH--LYMAN WIGHT'S
PROPOSAL OF A SOUTHWEST MOVEMENT FOR THE CHURCH.

_Tuesday, March 5, 1844.--_I saw Hyrum Kimball at Bryant's store, and
gave him a lecture on his resisting the ordinances of the city, by
telling the captains of the steamboats they need not pay wharfage, &c.

Rode out with Emma.

At two, p.m., met with the City Council. I copy the minutes:--

    _Special Session of the City Council_.

    March 5, 1844, 2 p.m.

    Names of members called. Quorum present.

    Mayor stated that he had called the council, because that when the
    wharf-master called on the steamboats for wharfage, the officers of
    the boats declined paying, assigning as a reason that Hyrum Kimball
    and -- Morrison had told them that they owned the land, and they
    need pay no wharfage to the city; and he called the council to know
    their views on the subject, as he had told Hyrum Kimball that he
    should see the ordinances executed; and if the boats did not pay,
    he should blow them up and all those who upheld them in resisting
    the ordinances. Every measure is taken to palsy the hands of the
    officers of the city; and I want to know how to remedy the evil, or
    whether I shall abandon the ordinances, &c.

    Alderman Harris said that it was the mayor's duty to enforce the
    ordinances of the city, and that no man has a right to build a
    wharf without leave from the city council.

    Councilor Phelps suggested the propriety of licensing those who
    owned wharves to collect a tax for the landing of the boat.

    {235} Alderman Wells concurred.

    Mayor said the land on the water's edge was a street.

    Alderman Wells suggested the propriety of having the street worked
    as soon as may be.

    Councilor Phelps said, if Water street extended round the city,
    then Kimball had been constructing a nuisance.

    Mayor spoke in explanation, and said that Kimball said, if the city
    would make a wharf, he would give up what he had done.

    Councilor Orson Spencer said he wished the mayor to execute the law
    of the city.

    Councilor Brigham Young concurred.

    Councilor W. W. Phelps proposed that Water street be worked the
    whole length.

    Councilor Taylor said, "I go in for executing the laws of the city."

    Marshal stated that Morrison said he had a bond for a deed to
    low-water mark, and the city could not take his personal rights,
    and he objected to the boats paying wharfage.

    Councilor Orson Pratt said, if Kimball or Morrison or any one else
    has built wharves since that street was laid out, they could get no
    damages.

    Councilor Daniel Spencer considered the ordinance passed good, and
    it ought to be enforced.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith, believed it was our duty to stand up to the
    ordinances.

    Moved by Brigham Young that the city council instruct the Mayor to
    order the supervisor to open Water street from Joseph Smith's store
    north to the north line of the city.

    Councilor Phelps approved of the motion, that the road might be
    cleared from rafts, and the rafts might also pay license.

    Councilor Warrington said the upper stone house was in the street.

    Mayor said that was the greatest nuisance there was in the street.

    Councilor Orson Spencer was in favor [i.e., of the motion to open
    Water street.] Motion carried unanimously.

    The governor having refused to issue commissions to the
    aldermen-elect of the city, Councilor Whitney inquired who were
    aldermen.

    The mayor explained that if the governor refuses to grant a
    commission, it does not disqualify the officer elect from acting in
    his office; consequently, there is no virtue in the commission, but
    the virtue of the office consists in the election.

    Councilor Young thought they were aldermen all the time or none of
    the time.

    Mayor said he wanted all the aldermen to be added to the city
    council.

    {236} Alderman Wells said he considered the election made the
    aldermen, and not the commission.

    Mayor said if he had been elected alderman and filed his bonds, he
    would act as councilor and magistrate.

[Sidenote: Packard's Memorial to Legislature of Massachusetts]

Noah Packard sent a memorial to the governor, senate, and house of
representatives of Massachusetts, his native state, setting forth in
detail the sufferings of the Saints in Missouri, and their expulsion
from that state.

_Wednesday, 6--_Went to my office, and thence with Brother Phelps to
Mr. Bryant's, to see him about his uniting with Hiram Kimball and
others to resist the ordinances of the city.

The _Neighbor_ publishes the name of James Arlington Bennett as

_Thursday, 7.--_A splendid day; wind from the southwest.

    _Minutes of a General Meeting in the Interest of the Temple_.

    [Reported by Elders Willard Richards and Wilford Woodruff.]

    A vast assembly of Saints met at the Temple of the Lord at nine
    o'clock a.m., by a special appointment of President Joseph Smith,
    for the purpose of advancing the progress of the Temple, &c.

    The Patriarch, Hyrum Smith, was present; also of the Twelve
    Apostles, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson
    Pratt, Willard Richards, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, and George
    A. Smith; also the temple committee and about eight thousand Saints.

    A hymn was sung by the choir; prayer by Elder Parley P. Pratt, when
    another hymn was sung.

    Patriarch Hyrum Smith took the stand and said, The object of the
    meeting is to stir up your minds by way of remembrance. It is
    necessary to have a starting-point, which is to build the Temple.

    With the assistance of the sisters, we expect to get the nails and
    glass; and with the assistance of the brethren, we expect to do the
    rest. I will proclaim in public and in private that the sisters
    bought the glass and nails by penny subscription. Choose ye this
    day whom ye will serve.

    We shall call upon this vast multitude for a donation to buy powder
    and fuse-ropes to blast the rocks in the quarry. We want the
    brethren to at least do as much as the sisters.

    {237} We do not intend to finish the Nauvoo House this season, but
    to take all the hands and finish the Temple this summer, or the
    walls of it, and get the roof on by December, and do off the inside
    next winter; and about a year from this spring we will dedicate it.

    We can do anything we undertake. We have power, and we can do great
    things. In five years to come the work will progress more than it
    has done for ten years past.

    Isaiah said we should perform a marvelous work and a wonder. I
    don't wonder he said so, if he saw this vast multitude; and I think
    this people is abundantly able to build this temple, and much
    depends upon it for our endowments and sealing powers; and many
    blessings depend upon it.

    President Joseph Smith then arrived, took the stand, arose, and,
    after requesting Orson Pratt to come to the stand and take his
    post, said:--

    I do not know whether the object of the meeting has been told you
    or not. I apologize for not coming sooner.

    I have had so much on my mind since I saw you, that I hardly know
    where to begin or what to say; but one of the grand objects I had
    in view in calling this meeting was to make a few remarks relative
    to the laws and ordinances of the city and the building of the
    temple.

    The reason I want to speak of the city ordinances is that the
    officers have difficulty in administering them.

    We are republicans, and wish to have the people rule; but they must
    rule in righteousness. Some would complain with what God Himself
    would do.

    The laws or ordinances are enacted by the city council on petition
    of the people; and they can all be repealed, if they wish it, and
    petition accordingly.

    At all events, the people ought not to complain of the officers;
    but if they are not satisfied, they should complain to the
    lawmakers by petition.

    I am instructed by the city council to tell this people that if
    there is any law passed by us which you dislike, we will repeal
    it, for we are your servants. Those who complain of our rights and
    charters are wicked and corrupt, and the devil is in them.

    The reason I called up this subject is, we have a gang of simple
    fellows here who do not know where their elbows or heads are.
    If you preach virtue to them, they will oppose that; or if you
    preach a Methodist God to them, they will oppose that; and the
    same if you preach anything else; and if there is any case tried
    by the authorities of Nauvoo, they want it appealed to Carthage
    to the circuit court. Mr. Orsimus F. Bostwick's case had to go to
    Carthage. Our lawyers will appeal anything to the circuit court.

    {238} I want the people to speak out and say whether such men
    should be tolerated and supported in our midst; and I want to know
    if the citizens will sustain me when my hands are raised to heaven
    for and in behalf of the people.

    From this time I design to bring such characters who act against
    the interests of the city before a committee of the whole; and I
    will have the voice of the people, which is republican, and is
    likely to be the voice of God; and as long as I have a tongue to
    speak, I will expose the iniquity of the lawyers and wicked men.

    I fear not their boiling over nor the boiling over of hell, their
    thunders nor the lightning of their forked tongues.

    If these things cannot be put a stop to, I will give such men into
    the hands of the Missouri mob. The hands of the officers of the
    city falter and are palsied by their conduct.

    There is another person I will speak about. He is a Mormon--a
    certain man who lived here before we came here; the two first
    letters of his name are Hiram Kimball. When a man is baptized and
    becomes a member of the Church, I have a right to talk about him,
    and reprove him in public or private, whenever it is necessary, or
    he deserves it.

    When the city passed an ordinance to collect wharfage from
    steamboats, he goes and tells the captains of the steamboats that
    he owned the landing, and that they need not pay wharfage.

    I despise the man who will betray you with a kiss; and I am
    determined to use up these men, if they will not stop their
    operations. If this is not true, let him come forward and throw off
    the imputation.

    When they appeal to Carthage, I will appeal to this people, which
    is the highest court. I despise the lawyers who haggle on lawsuits,
    and I would rather die a thousand deaths than appeal to Carthage,

    Kimball and Morrison say they own the wharves; but the fact is,
    the city owns them, sixty-four feet from high water mark. From the
    printing office to the north limits of the city is public ground,
    as Water street runs along the beach, and the beach belongs to the
    city and not to individuals.

    Another thing: I want to speak about the lawyers of this city. I
    have good feelings towards them; nevertheless I will reprove the
    lawyers and doctors anyhow. Jesus did, and every prophet has; and
    if I am a prophet, I shall do it: at any rate, I shall do it, for I
    profess to be a prophet.

    The maritime laws of the United States have ceded up the right to
    regulate all tolls, wharfage, &c., to the respective corporations
    who have jurisdiction, and not to individuals.

    Our lawyers have read so little that they are ignorant of this:
    they {239} have never stuck their noses into a book on maritime law
    in their lives, and, as Pope says:--

  Shallow draughts intoxicate the brain;
  Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring.

    Our city lawyers are fools to undertake to practice law when they
    know nothing about it.

    I want from this time forth every fool to stay at home and let the
    steamboats and captains alone. No vessel could land anywhere, if
    subject to individual laws.

    The corporation owns the streets of the city, and has as much right
    to tax the boats to make wharves as to tax citizens to make roads.
    Let every man in this city stay at home, and let the boat-captains,
    peace-officers and everybody alone.

    How are we to keep peace in the city, defend ourselves against
    mobs, and keep innocent blood from being shed? By striking a blow
    at everything that rises up in disorder.

    I will wage an eternal warfare with those that oppose me while I
    am laboring in behalf of the city. I will disgrace every man by
    publishing him on the house top, who will not be still and mind his
    own business. Let them entirely alone, and they will use themselves
    up.

    I was visited by an old gentleman this morning, who told me that
    the spirit of mobocracy was about subsiding. A couple of merchants
    in this city (I will not tell their names,) have told the country
    people not to bring butter, eggs, &c., to Nauvoo for sale; at
    least, so the people abroad say.

    Now, if they will not let the people bring their produce, the
    people will not buy their goods; and the result will be, the
    merchants will get a spirit of mobocracy.

    Another man (I will not call his name,) has been writing to the_
    New York Tribune,_ some of the most disgraceful things possible
    to name. He says, in that article, that there are a great many
    donations to the Temple which have been appropriated to other
    purposes.

    His object evidently was to stigmatize the trustee and excite
    prejudice against us abroad. But I pledge myself that whoever has
    contributed any old shoes, harness, horses, wagons, or anything
    else, if he will come forward, will show that every farthing is on
    the book and has been appropriated for the building of the Temple.

    I pledge myself that if he finds the first farthing that we cannot
    show where it has been appropriated, I will give him my head for a
    football.

    He also states that the Temple cannot be built, it costs so much.
    Who does not know that we can put the roof on the building this
    season, if we have a mind to? By turning all the means from the
    Nauvoo House and doubling our diligence we can do it.

    {240} There are men in our midst who are trying to build up
    themselves at our expense, and others who are watching for
    iniquity, and will make a man an offender for a word. The best way
    for such men is to be still. If I did not love men, I would not
    reprove them, but would work in the darkness as they do.

    As to who is the author of the article in the _Tribune,_ read it
    and you will see for yourselves. He is not a lawyer; he is nearer
    related to a doctor--a small man. (Mr. McNeil inquired if he was
    the man.) No; I do not know you: you are a stranger. But I will
    rest myself and give way for others.

    President Hyrum Smith arose and made a few remarks. He compared the
    lawyers to polliwogs, wigglers, and toads. He said they would dry
    up next fall. "Those characters, I presume, were made in gizzard
    making time, when it was cheaper to get gizzards than souls; for
    if a soul cost $5, a gizzard would cost nothing: like tree toads,
    they change color to suit the object they are upon. They ought to
    be ferreted out like rats. You could describe them as you would a
    hedgehog: they are in every hedge, stinking like the skunk." [1]

    Charles Foster asked if Joseph meant him.

    _Joseph_ said, "I will reply by asking you a question."

    _Foster_: "That is no way."

    _Joseph_. "Yes, that is the way the Quakers do. But Jesus said,
    'Whose image and superscription is this?' Why did you apply the
    remarks to yourself? Why did you ask if we meant you?"

    _Foster_. "Then I understand you meant me."

    _Joseph_. "You said it."

    _Foster_. "You shall hear from me."

    _Joseph_. "As Mayor, I fine you $10 for that threat, and for
    disturbing the meeting."

    Doctor Foster spoke in palliation of his brother Charles, and asked
    Joseph to await, &c. He said, "He has not threatened you." Joseph
    said, "He has." Doctor Foster said: "No one has heard him threaten
    you," when hundreds cried, "I have!" Doctor Foster continued to
    speak when the Mayor called him to order, or, said he, "I will fine
    you."

    William W. Phelps then read General Smith's "Views of the Powers
    and Policy of the General Government of the United States;" after
    which, it was voted, unanimously, with one exception, to uphold
    General Smith for the Presidency of the United States.

    {241} An article was also read by W. W. Phelps, entitled, "A Voice
    of Innocence from Nauvoo," and all the assembly said "Amen" twice.

    At thirty minutes past twelve, the meeting adjourned till two p.m.

    When the people assembled according to the adjournment, choir sang
    a hymn. Prayer by Elder Orson Pratt. Singing.

    President Brigham Young addressed the congregation. He said: I wish
    to speak on the duty of lawyers, as they have been spoken of this
    morning. They were first among the children of Israel to explain
    the laws of Moses to the common people.

    I class myself as a lawyer in Israel. My business is to make peace
    among the people; and when any man who calls himself a lawyer takes
    a course to break peace instead of making it, he is out of the line
    of his duty. A lawyer's duty is to read the law well himself, then
    tell the people what it is, and let them act upon it, and keep
    peace; and let them receive pay like any laboring man.

    It is desirable for justices of the peace, when men call for writs,
    to inquire into the merits of the case, and tell the parties how to
    settle it, and thus put down lawsuits. To cure lawing, let us pay
    attention to our business.

    When we hear a story, never tell it again, and it will be a perfect
    cure. If your brother mistreats you, let him alone; if your enemy
    cheats you, let it go; cease to deal with men who abuse you. If all
    men had taken the straightforward course that some have, we should
    not have such disorderly men in our midst.

    I have no objection to any man coming here, but I will have nothing
    to do with men who will abuse me at midnight and at noonday. Our
    difficulties and persecutions have always arisen from men right in
    our midst.

    It is the lust of individuals to rob us of everything, and to take
    advantage of divisions that may arise among us to build themselves
    up. I feel that I want every man should stay and lift up holy hands
    without dubiety, wrath or doubting.

    To the men who own land here I would say: Do not think you can sell
    your lands here, and then go off and spend it somewhere else in
    abusing the Mormons. I tell you nay; for know it, ye people, that
    Israel is here; and they are the head, and not the tail; and the
    people must learn it. All those who have gone from us have gone
    from the head to the tail.

    The grand object before us is to build the temple this season.

    We have heard the effects of slander, and we want a cure and balm;
    and I carry one with me all the while, and I want all of you to
    do the same. I will tell you what it is: it is to mind your own
    business, and let others alone, and suffer wrong rather than do
    wrong. If any take {242} your property away, let them alone, and
    have nothing to do with them.

    A spirit has been manifested to divide the Saints. It was manifest
    in the last election. It was said, if they did not look out, the
    Saints on the flat would beat the Saints on the hill.

    Great God! how such a thing looks, that the Saints should be afraid
    of beating one another in the election, or being beat? I would ask,
    who built up this city? Would steamboats have landed here, if the
    Saints had not come? Or could you, even the speculators, have sold
    your lands for anything here, if the Saints had not come? They
    might have sold for a few bear and wolf skins, but not for money.

    If any of you wish to know how to have your bread fall butter-side
    up, butter it on both sides, and then it will fall butter-side up.
    Oppose this work, and it will roll over you.

    When did this work ever stop since it began? Never. The only thing
    the Saints now want to know is--what does the Lord want of us, and
    we are ready to do it.

    Well, then, build the Temple of the Lord. Keep the law of God, ye
    Saints, and the hypocrite and scoundrel will flee out of your midst
    and tremble, for the fire of God will be too hot for them.

    I expect the Saints are so anxious to work, and so ready to do
    right, that God has whispered to the Prophet, "Build the Temple,
    and let the Nauvoo House alone at present." I would not sue a man,
    if he owed me five hundred or a thousand dollars, should he come to
    me and say he would not pay me.

    Elder John Taylor remarked that it was said by some discontented
    persons that the municipal officers of the city were acting in an
    arbitrary manner, which was false. He then went to explain the
    principles of Democracy, until it was announced that it would be
    desirable to set a contribution on foot immediately to get fuse
    rope and blasting powder, as a boat was coming down the river, and
    the messenger was waiting to go down to St. Louis.

    Elder Taylor paused awhile for this purpose, and a collection
    amounting to about sixty dollars was made. He then continued his
    speech: "When society was first organized they found themselves
    without legislature, congress, house of lords, or anything of the
    kind, every man was lord over his own house.

    Difficulties began to arise, and the people began to contend and
    combine together in governments. By-and-by, some two or three
    requested that they might return to their original customs, and the
    government said they might. This was the situation of this city in
    the main, when we asked for a charter.

    Of General Joseph Smith some are afraid, and think it doubtful
    about his election; and, like the ostrich, stick their heads under
    a bush, {243} and leave their bodies out, so that we can all see
    them; and after this it will be a by-word--"That man is an ostrich
    who hides his head in this cause." He spoke also on going on with
    the temple.

    President Brigham Young said--"Those who have not paid their
    property tithing we shall call upon, and take dinner; and we had
    rather be saved that trouble, and have them come up and pay. You
    will want a blessing in the temple when it is done."

    President Joseph Smith remarked:--In relation to those who give in
    property for the temple. We want them to bring it to the proper
    source, and to be careful into whose hands it comes, that it may
    be entered into the Church books, so that those whose names are
    found in the Church books shall have the first claim to receive
    their endowments in the temple. I intend to keep the door at the
    dedication myself, and not a man shall pass who has not paid his
    bonus.

    As to politics, I care but little about the presidential chair.
    I would not give half as much for the office of President
    of the United States as I would for the one I now hold as
    Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion.

    We have as good a right to make a political party to gain power to
    defend ourselves, as for demagogues to make use of our religion to
    get power to destroy us. In other words, as the world has used the
    power of government to oppress and persecute us, it is right for us
    to use it for the protection of our rights. We will whip the mob by
    getting up a candidate for President.

    When I get hold of the Eastern papers, and see how popular I am,
    I am afraid myself that I shall be elected; but if I should be, I
    would not say, "_Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you_."

    What I have said in my views in relation to the annexation of Texas
    is with some unpopular; the people are opposed to it. Some of the
    Anti-Mormons are good fellows. I say it, however, in anticipation
    that they will repent. They object to Texas on account of slavery.
    Why, it is the very reason she ought to be received, so that we
    may watch over them; for, of the two evils, we should reject the
    greatest.

    Governor Houston of Texas, says--"if you refuse to receive us
    into the United States, we must go to the British Government for
    protection."

    This would certainly be bad policy for this nation; the British are
    now throughout that whole country, trying to bribe all they can;
    and the first thing they would do, if they got possession, would be
    to set the negroes and the Indians to fight, and they would use us
    up. British officers are now running all over Texas to establish
    British influence in that country.

    It will be more honorable for us to receive Texas and set the
    negroes {244} free, and use the negroes and Indians against our
    foes. Don't let Texas go, lest our mothers and the daughters of the
    land should laugh us in the teeth; and if these things are not so,
    God never spoke by any Prophet since the world began.

    How much better it is for the nation to bear a little expense than
    to have the Indians and British upon us and destroy us all. We
    should grasp all the territory we can. I know much that I do not
    tell. I have had bribes offered me, but I have rejected them.

    The government will not receive any advice or counsel from me: they
    are self-sufficient. But they must go to hell and work out their
    own salvation with fear and trembling.

    The South holds the balance of power. By annexing Texas, I can do
    away with this evil. As soon as Texas was annexed, I would liberate
    the slaves in two or three States, indemnifying their owners, and
    send the negroes to Texas, and from Texas to Mexico, where all
    colors are alike. And if that was not sufficient, I would call upon
    Canada, and annex it.

[Sidenote: Arrival of Wm. Kay and Company of English Saints.]

The barque _Fanny_, Captain Patterson, arrived at New Orleans with
210 souls, led by Elder William Kay. They express, [the opinion] in
a letter to the _Millennial Star,_ that no people ever had a more
prosperous voyage than the Lord has favored this company with; and
such a captain and crew, for kindness, could scarcely be met with,
the captain frequently administering from the cabin stores unto the
necessities of all who required it.

Elder John E. Page published an address to the inhabitants of

_Friday, 8.--_Very heavy rain all night, accompanied by thunder.

Bishop Miller arrived from the Pinery.

[Sidenote: Jas. A. Bennett Ineligible for Vice-President of U.S.]

At ten a.m., my scribe, Willard Richards, called to tell me that James
Arlington Bennett was a native of Ireland, and therefore was not
constitutionally eligible to be the Vice-President. He wanted to know
who should be nominated for Vice-President. I told him to counsel with
others upon that {245} point, when he said he would call a council this
evening.

At seven p.m., the First Presidency, the Twelve, Bishop Miller, Levi
Richards, W. W. Phelps, and Lucian Woodworth assembled in the Mayor's
office, when W. W. Phelps read the following pacific communication,
which I had previously dictated him to write:--

    _A Friendly Hint to Missouri_.

    One of the most pleasing scenes that can occur on earth, when a sin
    has been committed by one person against another, is, to forgive
    that sin; and then according to the sublime and perfect pattern of
    the Savior, pray to our Father in heaven to forgive him also.

    Verily, verily, such a friendly rebuke is like the mellow zephyr
    of summer's eve--it soothes, it cheers and gladdens the heart
    of the humane and the savage. Well might the wise man exclaim,
    "A soft answer turneth away wrath; "for men of sense, judgment,
    and observation, in all the various periods of time, have been
    witnesses, figuratively speaking, that water, not wood, checks the
    rage of fire.

    Jesus said: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called
    the children of God." Wherefore if the nation, a single State,
    community, or family ought to be grateful for anything, it is peace.

    Peace, lovely child of heaven!--peace like light from the same
    great parent, gratifies, animates, and happifies the just and the
    unjust, and is the very essence of happiness below, and bliss above.

    He that does not strive with all his powers of body and mind,
    with all his influence at home and abroad, and to cause others to
    do so too--to seek peace and maintain it for his own benefit and
    convenience, and for the honor of his State, nation, and country,
    has no claim on the clemency of man; nor should he be entitled to
    the friendship of woman or the protection of government.

    He is the canker-worm to gnaw his own vitals; and the vulture to
    prey upon his own body; and he is, as to his own prospects and
    prosperity in life, a _felo-de-se_ of his own pleasure.

    A community of such beings are not far from hell on earth, and
    should be let alone as unfit for the smiles of the free or praise
    of the brave.

    But the peacemaker, O give ear to him! for the words of his mouth
    and his doctrine drop like the rain, and distil as the dew. They
    are like the gentle mist upon the herbs, and as the moderate shower
    upon the grass.

    Animation, virtue, love, contentment, philanthropy, benevolence,
    compassion, humanity and friendship push life into bliss: and
    men, a {246} little below the angels, exercising their powers,
    privileges, and knowledge according to the order, rules, and
    regulations of revelation, by Jesus Christ, dwell together in
    unity; and the sweet odor that is wafted by the breath of joy
    and satisfaction from their righteous communion is like the rich
    perfume from the consecrated oil that was poured upon the head of
    Aaron, or like the luscious fragrance that rises from the field of
    Arabian spices. Yea, more, the voice of the peacemaker--

  It is like the music of the spheres--
  It charms our souls and calms our fears;
  It turns the world to Paradise,
  And men to pearls of greater price.

    So much to preface this friendly hint to the state of Missouri:
    for, notwithstanding some of her private citizens and public
    officers have committed violence, robbery, and even murder upon
    the rights and persons of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints, yet compassion, dignity, and a sense of the principles of
    religion among all classes, and honor and benevolence, mingled
    with charity by high-minded patriots, lead me to suppose that
    there are many worthy people in that state who will use their
    influence and energies to bring about a settlement of all those old
    difficulties, and use all consistent means to urge the State, for
    her honor, prosperity, and good name, to restore every person she
    or her citizens have expelled from her limits, to their rights,
    and pay them all damage, that the great body of high-minded and
    well-disposed Southern and Western gentlemen and ladies--the
    real peace-makers or a western world, will go forth--good
    Samaritan-like, and pour in the oil and the wine, till all that
    can be healed are made whole; and after repentance, they shall be
    forgiven; for verily the Scriptures say, "Joy shall be in heaven
    over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety-and-nine just
    persons that need no repentance."

    Knowing the fallibility of man, considering the awful
    responsibility of rejecting the cries of the innocent, confident
    in the virtue and patriotism of the noble-minded Western men,
    tenacious of their character and standing, too high to stoop to
    disgraceful acts, and too proud to tolerate meanness in others;
    yea, may, I not say, without boasting that the best blood of the
    West, united with the honor of the illustrious fathers of freedom,
    will move, as the forest is moved by a mighty wind, to promote
    peace and friendship in every part of our wide-spread, lovely
    country.

    Filled with a love almost unspeakable, and moved by a desire
    pleasant as the dew of heaven, I supplicate not only our Father
    above, but also the civil, the enlightened, the intelligent, the
    social, and the best inhabitants of Missouri--those that feel bound
    by principles of honor, justice, moral greatness, and national
    pride, to arise in the character of {247} virtuous freemen from
    the disgrace and reproach that might inadvertently blur their good
    names, for want of self-preservation.

    Now is the time to brush off the monster that, incubus-like, seems
    hanging upon the reputation of the whole State. A little exertion,
    and the infamy of the evil will blacken the guilty only, for is it
    not written, "The tree is known by its fruit?"

    The voice of reason, the voice of humanity, the voice of the
    nation, and the voice of Heaven seem to say to the honest and
    virtuous throughout the State of Missouri, wash yourselves, make
    you clean, lest your negligence should be taken by the world, from
    the mass of facts before it, that you are guilty!

    Let there be one unison of hearts for justice; and when you
    reflect around your own firesides, remember that fifteen thousand
    once among you, now not, but who are just as much entitled to the
    privileges and blessings you enjoy as yourselves, like the widow
    before the unjust judge, are fervently praying for their rights.

    When you meditate upon the massacre at Haun's mill, forget not that
    the Constitution of your State holds this broad truth to the world,
    that none shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, but by
    the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.

    And when you assemble together in towns, counties, or districts,
    whether to petition your legislature to pay the damage the Saints
    have sustained in your State, by reason of oppression and misguided
    zeal, or to restore them to their rights according to Republican
    principles and benevolent designs, reflect, and make honorable,
    or annihilate, such statute law as was in force in your state in
    1838,--_viz._: "If twelve or more persons shall combine to levy war
    against any part of the people of this state, or to remove [them]
    forcibly out of the state or from their habitations, evidenced by
    taking arms and assembling to accomplish such purpose, every person
    so offending shall be punished by imprisonment in the Penitentiary
    for a period not exceeding five years, or by a fine not exceeding
    five thousand dollars and imprisonment in the county jail not
    exceeding six months."

    Finally, if honor dignifies an honest people, if virtue exalts
    a community, if wisdom guides great men, if principle governs
    intelligent beings, if humanity spreads comfort among the needy,
    and if religion affords consolation by showing that charity is the
    first, best and sweetest token of perfect love, then, O ye good
    people of Missouri, like the woman in Scripture who had lost one of
    her ten pieces of silver, arise, search diligently till you find
    the lost piece, and then make a feast, and call in your friends for
    joy.

    With due consideration, I am the friend of all good men,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

Our worthy brother, King Follett, died this morning occasioned by the

act of lowering the rock to him.

    {249} KING FOLLETT BIOGRAPHY.

    Elder Follett was one of those who bore the burden, in common with
    others of his brethren, in the days when men's faith was put to the
    test. He was a native of Vermont and moved many years since into
    Cuyahoga county, Ohio.

    There, for the first time, he heard the Gospel preached, united
    with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the spring
    of 1831, and has been a sharer in the afflictions through which the
    Saints have passed from that time until the time of his death.

    He shared in the violence of Missouri persecution, was cast into
    prison, and endured many months' imprisonment; and, after long
    delay, obtained a trial on the charges preferred against him, and
    was honorably discharged, being acquitted of all the crimes with
    which a band of wicked persecutors could charge him.

    All the persecutions he endured only tended to strengthen his faith
    and confirm his hope; and he died as he had lived, rejoicing in the
    hope of future felicity.

    Having united with the Church in the forty-first year of his age,
    he filled up the prime of his life in the service of his God, and
    went to rest in his fifty-sixth year, being fifty-five years, seven
    months, and fourteen days old when he slept the sleep of death.

    So the righteous pass, and so they sleep, until the mandate of Him
    for whom they suffer and in whom they trust shall call them forth
    to glory, honor, immortality and eternal life.

_Sunday, 10.--_Frost in the night; beautiful day. South wind.

Brother King Follett was buried this day with Masonic honors.

I attended meeting at the stand, and preached on the subject of Elias,
Elijah, and Messiah. [A sketch of which was reported by Elder Wilford
Woodruff, as follows]:--

    _Discourse of the Prophet.--Elias, Elijah, Messiah_.

    There is a difference between the spirit and office of Elias and
    Elijah. It is the spirit of Elias I wish first to speak of; and in
    order to come at the subject, I will bring some of the testimony
    from the Scripture and give my own.

    In the first place, suffice it to say, I went into the woods to
    inquire of {250} the Lord, by prayer, His will concerning me, and I
    saw an angel, and he laid his hands upon my head, and ordained me
    to a Priest after the order of Aaron, and to hold the keys of this
    Priesthood, which office was to preach repentance and baptism for
    the remission of sins, and also to baptize. But I was informed that
    this office did not extend to the laying on of hands for the giving
    of the Holy Ghost; that that office was a greater work, and was to
    be given afterward; but that my ordination was a preparatory work,
    or a going before, which was the spirit of Elias; for the spirit
    of Elias was a going before to prepare the way for the greater,
    which was the case with John the Baptist. He came crying through
    the wilderness, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths
    straight." And they were informed, if they could receive it, it
    was the spirit of Elias; and John was very particular to tell the
    people, he was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
    Light.

    He told the people that his mission was to preach repentance and
    baptize with water; but it was He that should come after him that
    should baptize with fire and the Holy Ghost.

    If he had been an imposter, he might have gone to work beyond his
    bounds, and undertook to have performed ordinances which did not
    belong to that office and calling, under the spirit of Elias.

    The spirit of Elias is to prepare the way for a greater revelation
    of God, which is the Priesthood of Elias, or the Priesthood that
    Aaron was ordained unto. And when God sends a man into the world to
    prepare for a greater work, holding the keys of the power of Elias,
    it was called the doctrine of Elias, even from the early ages of
    the world.

    John's mission was limited to preaching and baptizing: but what
    he did was legal; and when Jesus Christ came to any of John's
    disciples, He baptized them with fire and the Holy Ghost.

    We find the apostles endowed with greater power than John: their
    office was more under the spirit and power of Elijah than Elias.

    In the case of Phillip when he went down to Samaria, when he was
    under the spirit of Elias, he baptized both men and women. When
    Peter and John heard of it, they went down and laid hands upon
    them, and they received the Holy Ghost. This shows the distinction
    between the two powers.

    When Paul came to certain disciples, he asked if they had received
    the Holy Ghost? They said, No. Who baptized you, then? We were
    baptized unto John's baptism. No, you were not baptized unto John's
    baptism, or you would have been baptized by John. And so Paul went
    and baptized them, for he knew what the true doctrine was, and he
    knew that John had not baptized them. And these principles are
    {251} strange to me, that men who have read the Scriptures of the
    New Testament are so far from it.

    What I want to impress upon your minds is the difference of power
    in the different parts of the Priesthood, so that when any man
    comes among you, saying, "I have the spirit of Elias," you can know
    whether he be true or false; for any man that comes, having the
    spirit and power of Elias, he will not transcend his bounds.

    John did not transcend his bounds, but faithfully performed that
    part belonging to his office; and every portion of the great
    building should be prepared right and assigned to its proper place;
    and it is necessary to know who holds the keys of power, and who
    does not, or we may be likely to be deceived.

    That person who holds the keys of Elias hath a preparatory work.
    But if I spend much more time in conversing about the spirit of
    Elias, I shall not have time to do justice to the spirit and power
    of Elijah.

    This is the Elias spoken of in the last days, and here is the rock
    upon which many split, thinking the time was past in the days of
    John and Christ, and no more to be. But the spirit of Elias was
    revealed to me, and I know it is true; therefore I speak with
    boldness, for I know verily my doctrine is true.

    Now for Elijah. The spirit, power, and calling of Elijah is, that
    ye have power to hold the key of the revelation, ordinances,
    oracles, powers and endowments of the fullness of the Melchizedek
    Priesthood and of the kingdom of God on the earth; and to receive,
    obtain, and perform all the ordinances belonging to the kingdom of
    God, even unto the turning of the hearts of the fathers unto the
    children, and the hearts of the children unto the fathers, even
    those who are in heaven.

    Malachi says, "I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
    of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the
    heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children
    to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse."

    Now, what I am after is the knowledge of God, and I take my own
    course to obtain it. What are we to understand by this in the last
    days?

    In the days of Noah, God destroyed the world by a flood, and He
    has promised to destroy it by fire in the last days: but before it
    should take place, Elijah should first come and turn the hearts of
    the fathers to the children, &c.

    Now comes the point. What is this office and work of Elijah?
    It is one of the greatest and most important subjects that God
    has revealed. He should send Elijah to seal the children to the
    fathers, and the fathers to the children.

    Now was this merely confined to the living, to settle difficulties
    with {252} families on earth? By no means. It was a far greater
    work. Elijah! what would you do if you were here? Would you confine
    your work to the living alone? No; I would refer you to the
    Scriptures, where the subject is manifest: that is, without us,
    they could not be made perfect, nor we without them; the fathers
    without the children, nor the children without the fathers.

    I wish you to understand this subject, for it is important; and
    if you will receive it, this is the spirit of Elijah, that we
    redeem our dead, and connect ourselves with our fathers which
    are in heaven, and seal up our dead to come forth in the first
    resurrection; and here we want the power of Elijah to seal those
    who dwell on earth to those who dwell in heaven. This is the power
    of Elijah and the keys of the kingdom of Jehovah.

    Let us suppose a case. Suppose the great God who dwells in heaven
    should reveal Himself to Father Cutler here, by the opening
    heavens, and tell him, "I offer up a decree that whatsoever you
    seal on earth with your decree, I will seal it in heaven; you
    have the power then; can it be taken off? No. Then what you seal
    on earth, by the keys of Elijah, is sealed in heaven; and this is
    the power of Elijah, and this is the difference between the spirit
    and power of Elias and Elijah; for while the spirit of Elias is a
    forerunner, the power of Elijah is sufficient to make our calling
    and election sure; and the same doctrine, where we are exhorted to
    go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance
    from dead works, and of laying on of hands, resurrection of the
    dead, &c.

    We cannot be perfect without the fathers, &c. We must have
    revelation from them, and we can see that the doctrine of
    revelation far transcends the doctrine of no revelation; for one
    truth revealed from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in
    existence.

    This spirit of Elijah was manifest in the days of the apostles, in
    delivering certain ones to the buffetings of Satan, that they might
    be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They were sealed by the
    spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of hell until the day of the
    Lord, or revelation of Jesus Christ.

    Here is the doctrine of election that the world has quarreled so
    much about; but they do not know anything about it.

    The doctrine that the Presbyterians and Methodists have quarreled
    so much about--once in grace, always in grace, or falling away
    from grace, I will say a word about. They are both wrong. Truth
    takes a road between them both, for while the Presbyterian says
    "once in grace, you cannot fall;" the Methodist says: "You can have
    grace today, fall from it tomorrow, next day have grace again;
    and so follow on, changing continually." But the doctrine of the
    Scriptures and the {253} spirit of Elijah would show them both
    false, and take a road between them both; for, according to the
    Scripture, if men have received the good word of God, and tasted
    of the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, it
    is impossible to renew them again, seeing they have crucified the
    Son of God afresh, and put Him to an open shame; so there is a
    possibility of falling away; you could not be renewed again, and
    the power of Elijah cannot seal against this sin, for this is a
    reserve made in the seals and power of the Priesthood.

    I will make every doctrine plain that I present, and it shall stand
    upon a firm basis, and I am at the defiance of the world, for I
    will take shelter under the broad cover of the wings of the work in
    which I am engaged. It matters not to me if all hell boils over; I
    regard it only as I would the crackling of the thorns under a pot.

    A murderer, for instance, one that sheds innocent blood, cannot
    have forgiveness. David sought repentance at the hand of God
    carefully with tears, for the murder of Uriah; but he could only
    get it through hell: he got a promise that his soul should not be
    left in hell.

    Although David was a king, he never did obtain the spirit and power
    of Elijah and the fullness of the Priesthood; and the Priesthood
    that he received, and the throne and kingdom of David is to be
    taken from him and given to another by the name of David in the
    last days, raised up out of his lineage.

    Peter referred to the same subject on the day of Pentecost, but the
    multitude did not get the endowment that Peter had; but several
    days after, the people asked "What shall we do?" Peter says, "I
    would ye had done it ignorantly," speaking of crucifying the Lord,
    &c. He did not say to them, "Repent and be baptized, for the
    remission of your sins;" but he said, "Repent ye therefore, and be
    converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of
    refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord." (Acts iii.
    19.)

    This is the case with murderers. They could not be baptized for the
    remission of sins for they had shed innocent blood.

    Again: The doctrine or sealing power of Elijah is as follows:--If
    you have power to seal on earth and in heaven, then we should be
    wise. The first thing you do, go and seal on earth your sons and
    daughters unto yourself, and yourself unto your fathers in eternal
    glory. * * * * * * * I will walk through the gate of heaven and
    claim what I seal, and those that follow me and my counsel.

    The Lord once told me that what I asked for I should have. I have
    been afraid to ask God to kill my enemies, lest some of them
    should, peradventure, repent.

    I asked a short time since for the Lord to deliver me out of the
    hands of the Governor of Missouri, and if it needs must be to
    accomplish it, to {254} take him away; and the next news that came
    pouring down from there was, that _Governor Reynolds had shot
    himself._ And I would now say, "Beware, O earth, how you fight
    against the Saints of God and shed innocent blood; for in the days
    of Elijah, his enemies came upon him, and fire was called down from
    heaven and destroyed them.

    The spirit of Elias is first, Elijah second, and Messiah last.
    Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way, and the spirit and power
    of Elijah is to come after, holding the keys of power, building
    the Temple to the capstone, placing the seals of the Melchizedek
    Priesthood upon the house of Israel, and making all things ready;
    then Messiah comes to His Temple, which is last of all.

    Messiah is above the spirit and power of Elijah, for He made the
    world, and was that spiritual rock unto Moses in the wilderness.
    Elijah was to come and prepare the way and build up the kingdom
    before the coming of the great day of the Lord, although the spirit
    of Elias might begin it.

    I have asked of the Lord concerning His coming; and while asking
    the Lord, He gave a sign and said, "In the days of Noah I set a
    bow in the heavens as a sign and token that in any year that the
    bow should be seen the Lord would not come; but there should be
    seed time and harvest during that year: but whenever you see the
    bow withdrawn, it shall be a token that there shall be famine,
    pestilence, and great distress among the nations, and that the
    coming of the Messiah is not far distant.

    But I will take the responsibility upon myself to prophesy in
    the name of the Lord, that Christ will not come this year, as
    Father Miller has prophesied, for we have seen the bow; and I also
    prophesy, in the name of the Lord, that Christ will not come in
    forty years; and if God ever spoke by my mouth, He will not come in
    that length of time. Brethren, when you go home, write this down,
    that it may be remembered.

    Jesus Christ never did reveal to any man the precise time that
    He would come. Go and read the Scriptures, and you cannot find
    anything that specifies the exact hour He would come; and all that
    say so are false teachers.

    There are some important things concerning the office of the
    Messiah in the organization of the world, which I will speak of
    hereafter, May God Almighty bless you and pour out His Spirit upon
    you, is the prayer of your unworthy servant. Amen.

At half-past three p.m., I met with the Twelve, Bishop Miller and the
Temple Committee, in the Nauvoo Mansion.

{255} The following letter from Lyman Wight and others was read:--

    _Letter:--Lyman Wight to the First Presidency--Preaching the Gospel
    to the Indians and Proposing to Migrate to Texas_.

    BLACK RIVER FALLS, Feb. 15, 1844.

    _To the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve of the Church
    of Christ of Latter-day Saints_.

    DEAR BRETHREN,--Through the goodness and mercy of God, the Eternal
    Father, and grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we are
    permitted to write and send by a special messenger a concise
    account of our lumbering operations, together with the apparent
    prospects of the introduction and spread of the Gospel among the
    Chippewa and Menomanee Indians, and also the projects of our hearts
    in regard to future operations in spreading the Gospel south in
    all the extent of America, and the consequences growing out of the
    same, all of which we beg leave to submit to your consideration
    that we may have your concurrence, or such views as shall be in
    accordance with the mind and will of the Lord, and govern ourselves
    in accordance therewith.

    Since we have been here lumbering, we have had many difficulties
    to encounter; but the main hindrance to our successful operations
    was the feeding, clothing, and transporting a great many lazy,
    idle men, who have not produced anything by their pretended labor,
    and thus eating up all that the diligent and honest could produce
    by their unceasing application to labor; and we have not yet got
    entirely clear of such persons.

    But under all these mighty clogs and hindrances, we have been able
    to accomplish and have in progress, so that we can deliver in
    Nauvoo about one million feet of lumber by the last of July next,
    which will be a great deal more than what is necessary to build
    the Temple and the Nauvoo House. Besides all this, we have made
    valuable improvements here,--all the result of much labor done
    under trying circumstances.

    We have recently ascertained that the lands from the falls of Black
    River to its sources are the property of the Menomanee Indians,
    and the general government having urged them to move off the lands
    in the vicinity of Green Bay to their own lands. The Indians say
    they will, provided the Government will remove all strange Indians
    and trespassing white men off their lands; consequently, the agent
    and superintendent of Indian Affairs are taking such steps as will
    stop all further trespassing on the Indian lands, on the Wisconsin,
    Black and Chippewa rivers, under the penalties of the laws relative
    to the cases.

    {256} We sent Brothers Miller and Daniels, in company with the
    principal chief of the Menomanee Indians, overland to the Wisconsin
    river, to ascertain more about the matter. They saw the agent;
    found him a gruff, austere man, determined to stop all trespassing
    on Indian lands.

    The Indians are willing to sell privileges to individuals for
    lumbering and cutting timber, as they have hitherto done; but the
    agent is opposed to it. Thus a difficulty arises between themselves.

    Now, as regards the introduction of the Gospel of Christ among the
    Indians here, it will require more exertion, to all appearances, to
    check the enthusiastic ardor of these our red brethren, until the
    full principles of faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ shall
    be reasoned into their minds, than to urge them on to receive it.
    They have great confidence in us.

    The country belonging to these northern Indians is a dreary, cold
    region, and to a great extent, cranberry marshes, pine barrens, and
    swamps, with a small amount of good lands, scarce of game, and only
    valuable in mill privileges and facilities for lumbering purposes.

    As to mineral resources, they have not been fully developed. There
    is no doubt as to the abundance of iron ore, but uncertain as to
    quality.

    Now, under all these circumstances, a few of us here have
    arrived at this conclusion in our minds (such as can undergo all
    things,)--that as the Gospel has not been fully opened in all the
    South and Southwestern States, as also Texas, Mexico, Brazil, &c.,
    together with the West Indian Islands, having produced lumber
    enough to build the Temple and Nauvoo House,--also having an
    influence over the Indians, so as to induce them to sell their
    lands to the United States, and go to a climate southwest, (all
    according to the policy of the U. S. Government),--and having also
    become convinced that the Church at Nauvoo or in the Eastern States
    will not build the Nauvoo House according to the commandment,
    neither the Temple in a reasonable time, and that we have, so
    far as we have made trials, got means in the south,--we have in
    our minds to go to the table-lands of Texas, to a point we may
    find to be the most eligible, there locate, and let it be a place
    of gathering for all the South (they being incumbered with that
    unfortunate race of beings, the negroes); and for us to employ our
    time and talents in gathering together means to build according to
    the commandments of our God, and spread the Gospel to the nations
    according to the will of our Heavenly Father. We, therefore, our
    beloved brethren, send our worthy Brother Young, with a few of our
    thoughts, on paper, that you may take the subject-matter under
    consideration, and return us such instructions as may be according
    to the mind and will of the Lord our God.

    We have thought it best to sell the mills here, if you think it
    expedient. We feel greatly encouraged to spend and be spent in the
    cause of Christ, according to the will of our Heavenly Father.

    {257} You will, therefore, after due deliberation, send us, by the
    hands of Brother Young, such instructions as may be the result of
    your deliberations.

    Holding ourselves ready under all circumstances in life to try to
    do all things whatsoever commanded or instructed to do by those
    ordained to direct the officers of the Church of Jesus Christ;
    subscribing ourselves yours truly, while life shall endure,

    Church at Black River Falls.

    Joseph Smith, P. C.,

    Brigham Young, P. T.,

    Willard Richards, Clerk.

Also a letter to myself from Lyman Wight and others--

    _Letter:--Lyman Wight to President Joseph Smith--Suggesting a
    Southwest Movement for the Church_.

    BLACK RIVER FALLS, WISCONSIN TERRITORY,

    February 15th, 1844.

    _To Joseph Smith, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of
    Latter-day Saints, and to the Twelve Apostles, greeting:--_

    Believing a concert of action in all things in this Church
    to be highly important, we deem it necessary, under existing
    circumstances, to make you acquainted with our views, feelings, and
    temporal and spiritual prospects, as they now exist.

    We wrote you last fall a full and complete description of this
    country as high as the falls on Black River, without exaggeration,
    giving a slight description of the Pinery.

    With the exception of several renegades and false brethren, things
    passed smoothly until some time in the month of January, when we
    were visited by three different tribes of Lamanites upon the most
    friendly terms, receiving us as their counselors, both temporal and
    spiritual.

    The names of those tribes are Menomanees, Chippewa, and
    Winnebagoes. They informed us that all the land above the falls
    belongs to the Menomanee tribe, and that the agents and the
    governor, the general {258} agent in the northwest of all the
    Indian affairs, had agreed with them to remove all the lumbermen
    from Black River, Chippewa, and Lemanware rivers, by their request;
    but after a lengthy conversation with them, they felt to treat us
    as their friends, and not their enemies.

    We dispatched two messengers--namely, George Miller and Cyrus
    Daniels, to go immediately to Wisconsin, where they met with the
    agent, who gave them to understand we could get the timber, which
    is already cut, at a reasonable rate, and for any future prospect
    we will be under the necessity of entering into a contract.

    We calculate the present prospect for lumber betwixt this and the
    last of July next will be from eight to twelve hundred thousand
    feet, which we deem will be all sufficient to finish the two
    houses, which will accomplish the mission on which we started to
    this country.

    We, therefore, as a branch and a member of the body of the
    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chose the following
    committee--namely, Lyman Wight, George Miller, Pierce Hawley,
    Phineas R. Bird and John Young, to correspond with your reverend
    council, giving you our views concerning matters and things, and
    requesting your counsel on the same.

    This committee views it inexpedient to purchase standing timber on
    so rapid and unnavigable a stream for the purpose of making lumber
    to gain wealth.

    The Lamanites owning this land, notwithstanding their great anxiety
    to receive the Gospel and the Book of Mormon, have a strong desire,
    if counseled by us so to do, to go south-west, where game is more
    plentiful as their only resource here for a living is the pitiful
    annuities and proceeds from their pine timber, which timber is the
    only inducement to the Government to purchase their lands.

    This committee is therefore led to take a brief view of the south
    and western part of North America, together with the Floridas,
    Texas, West India Islands, and the adjacent islands to the Gulf
    of Mexico, together with the Lamanites bordering on the United
    Territories from Green Bay to the Mexican Gulf, all crying with one
    voice, through the medium of their chiefs, Give us an understanding
    of your doctrine and principles, for we perceive that your ways are
    equal, and your righteousness far exceeds the righteousness of all
    the missionaries that we have yet become acquainted with,--that
    your conduct with one another is like that of ours, and that all
    your feasts and attendant ceremonies are precisely like ours.

    Your servants, the committee, have viewed the Colorado river, with
    all its beautiful hills and valleys and fertile soil, with deep
    regret, when viewing the countless thousands of inhabitants on
    either side thereof, without the knowledge of God or the doctrine
    of the Church of Jesus {259} Christ of Latter-day Saints, and say
    in their hearts, Would it be expedient to form a mission of those
    true and full-blooded Ephraimites, who, from principle, and the
    love of the truth, have borne the most extreme burdens, fatigue,
    and hunger, to prosecute the mission, to procure lumber sufficient
    to build the two houses, to open the door to all the regions which
    we have named, which regions have never yet had an opportunity
    to hear the Gospel and to be made acquainted with the plan of
    salvation? or shall they continue to suffer the fatigues of hunger,
    wet and cold, in a rigid, inclement climate, for the pitiful sum
    that it shall avail them, after undergoing those hazardous perils?
    or shall they, like Timothy and Titus, with Paul, hazard the perils
    of the sea and land through the Southern States and West India
    Islands, and all the Lamanite world, go forth and proclaim to them
    the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and teach them to
    build up Zion?

    Are there not thousands of the rich planters who would embrace the
    Gospel, and, if they had a place to plant their slaves, give all
    the proceeds of their yearly labor, if rightly taught, for building
    up the kingdom, being directed by the President of the whole Church
    to make the right application? We answer, Yes, we believe they
    would.

    Your servants, the committee, are of the opinion that a concerted
    and reciprocity of action between the North and the South would
    greatly advance the building up of the kingdom.

    The committee is well informed of the Cherokee and the Chocktaw
    nations who live between the state of Arkansas and the Colorado
    river of the Texans, owning large plantations and thousands of
    slaves, and that they are also very desirous to have an interview
    with the Elders of this Church, upon the principles of the Book of
    Mormon.

    This committee is of the opinion that they can choose soldiers for
    this expedition who are as undeviating in the principles of the
    doctrine of Christ and the Book of Mormon as the sun in his daily
    course, and as indefatigable in their exertions in this cause as
    the earth is in its daily revolution.

    This committee views it as a matter of investigation, whether would
    the Southerner, with his slaves and abundance of wealth, do better
    to take them to some slave-holding point, keep them in lively
    exercise according to his former customs and habits turning over
    his yearly proceeds into the hands of the Trustee-in-Trust for the
    whole Church, or to abolish slavery and settle himself in a climate
    uncongenial to his nature and entirely derogatory to his former
    occupations in life?

    After having procured the lumber for those two houses, the
    committee is of the opinion that the preaching of the Gospel and
    raising funds {260} in the south would be a far more speedy way of
    accomplishing the work than any other that could be introduced at
    the present time.

    We, your servants, therefore, will wait patiently the result
    of your council, and submit ourselves to the same with all
    cheerfulness, our only object being to advance the cause and
    kingdom of God, stand ready to take hold wherever your wise council
    may consider it to be of the most advantage.

    This committee view with deep regret the many different teachings
    this Church has received concerning the distribution of their
    property, such as raising funds for the printing of tracts,
    evidences of the Book of Mormon, and pamphlets of various
    descriptions, which we consider has not advanced the cause in the
    least degree, but has tended directly to sap the foundation of
    building the houses.

    We therefore believe that no person embracing the doctrine of the
    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should give any part or
    parcel of the property without a direct counsel, written or oral,
    from the First Presidency of the Church.

    Whereas the committee having appointed George Miller and Lyman
    Wight to write the views of the committee, each wrote separate and
    apart, having laid the same before the committee, the committee
    resolved that both productions be sent without alterations.

    We, the committee, conclude by subscribing ourselves your friends
    and well-wishers in the Lord, praying a speedy answer from your
    worthy council, or the word of the Lord.

    and also the best policy for this people to adopt to obtain their
    rights from the nation and insure protection for themselves and
    children; and to secure a resting place in the mountains, or some
    uninhabited region, where we can enjoy the liberty of conscience
    guaranteed to us by the Constitution of our country, rendered
    doubly sacred by the precious blood of our fathers, and denied to
    us by the present authorities, who have smuggled themselves into
    power in the States and Nation.

Footnotes:

1. Nauvoo was unfortunate in being overrun with pettifogging lawyers
at this time, and it was to these, doubtless, that the disparaging
remarks of both the Prophet and Hyrum, respecting lawyers referred. It
is unfortunate that they did not segregate the pettifoggers from the
worthy men of the profession; than whom no class of citizens, and no
other profession, render more valuable service to the state.

{263} A dull cloudy day.

[Sidenote: Co-operative Store Planned.]

A meeting of the inhabitants of the Tenth ward was held this evening
at the schoolhouse on the hill, in Parley street, to take into
consideration the propriety of establishing a store on the principle of
co-operation or reciprocity. The subject was fully investigated, and
the benefits of such an institution clearly pointed out.

The plan proposed for carrying out the object of the meeting was by
shares of five dollars each.

The leading feature of the institution was to give employment to our
own mechanics, by supplying the raw material, and manufacturing all
sorts of domestic goods, and furnishing the necessaries and comforts of
life on the lowest possible terms.

A committee was appointed to draft a plan for the government of said
institute, to be submitted for adoption or amendment at their next
meeting; after which an adjournment took place till next Tuesday
evening, at half-past: six o'clock, at the same place.

_Wednesday, 13.--_In special council from nine to twelve a.m. Orson
Hyde, Wilford Woodruff and James Emmett were present, in addition to
those of the preceding day. Willard Richards was appointed historian,
and William Clayton clerk of the council.

It was decided that Amos Fielding should return to England, when I and
my brother Hyrum gave him the following letter of attorney:--

    _Credentials of Elder Amos Fielding on Departing for England_.

    "This is to certify that the bearer thereof, our worthy brother
    Elder Amos Fielding, hath been appointed by the First Presidency
    of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, our agent, to
    transact such business as may be deemed necessary for the benefit
    of said Church, and such as he shall see proper throughout the
    island of Great Britain.

    He is hereby authorized to receive moneys for the Temple in Nauvoo,
    {264} the poor, or for the Church; and the brethren will be safe
    should they deposit money in his hands for any purpose pertaining
    to the Church business in this place.

    In witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands and placed the
    corporation seal of City of Nauvoo this 13th day of March, A. D.
    1844.

    Saints.

_Thursday, 14.--_In special council over the store from nine till one.

At two, went to see Brother John Wilkie. He had sent to me to come and
see him. He wanted to know what he should do. I told him of the order
of tithing, &c., and he wanted I should come again.

At four, went to assembly room again. Lucien Woodworth sent on a
mission to Texas. At seven, adjourned to next Tuesday, at nine, a.m.

_Friday 15.--_Dull, cloudy day, north wind. Frosty night. Spent the day
in council.

Being in a strait to raise money to assist the hands in the Pine
country, I sent Elders Brigham and Willard Richards to borrow some
money from Mr. Orme, who, it is believed, had a large sum of money
lying idle, but they did not get any.

I copy from the Law of the Lord:--

    _John Wilkie. The Blessing of the Prophet upon Him_.

    "This day President Joseph Smith rode over to Brother John Wilkie's
    at his special request, to give him some instructions relative to
    his duty in regard to tithing and consecration.

    Brother Wilkie has for a long time back been struggling with his
    feelings, designing to do right, but laboring under many fears and
    prejudices, in consequence of having in some degree given way to
    believe the base reports circulated by individuals for the purpose
    of injuring the authorities of the Church, and also from various
    other causes. His faithful companion has persevered diligently, and
    with fervent prayer has called upon God in his behalf, until she
    has realized her utmost wishes.

    {265} Brother Wilkie now feels anxious to do right in all things,
    and especially to pay his tithing to the full. President Joseph
    showed him the principles of consecration and the means whereby
    he might realize the fullness of the blessings of the celestial
    kingdom; and as an evidence that he desired to do right, he paid
    over to the Trustee-in-Trust the sum of three hundred dollars in
    gold and silver for the benefit of the Temple, and which is now
    recorded on consecration.

    He also signified his intention of paying more as soon as he could
    get matters properly arranged. The president then pronounced a
    blessing upon him and his companion, that they should have the
    blessing of God to attend them in their basket and in their
    store--that they should have the blessing of health and salvation
    and long life, inasmuch as they would continue to walk in obedience
    to the commandments of God.

    May the Lord grant his Spirit and peace to abide upon Brother
    Wilkie and his companion through the remainder of their days; may
    their hearts expand and become enlarged to receive the fullness of
    the blessings of the kingdom of heaven; may they have the light
    of eternal truth continually springing up in them like a well of
    living water; may they be shielded from the powers of Satan and the
    influence of designing men, and their faith increase from day to
    day until they shall have power to lay hold on the blessings of God
    and the gifts of the Spirit until they are satisfied; and, finally,
    may they live to a good old age; and when they have lived while
    they desire life, may they die in peace and be received into the
    mansions of eternal life, and enjoy a celestial glory forever and
    ever! Even so, amen.

The editors of the _Times and Seasons_ published a short account of
"Our City and the Present Aspect of Affairs," which we insert.

    STATUS OF NAUVOO IN THE SPRING OF 1844.

    Believing that our patrons and friends are pleased to hear of our
    prosperity, we feel happy in apprising them of the same, through
    the columns of our paper.

    Owing to the scarcity of provision and the pressure in the money
    market during the past winter, commercial business has been
    somewhat dull; consequently, those who were not previously prepared
    have been obliged to employ the principal portion of their time in
    obtaining the necessary means for the sustenance of their families:
    therefore little improvement has been made. But old Boreas is now
    on his receding march, and spring has commenced its return with all
    its pleasantness.

    {266} Navigation is open, and steamboats are almost continually
    plying up and down our majestic river. They have already brought
    several families of emigrants to this place, who have cordially
    joined with their friends and brethren in the great work of the
    upbuilding of Zion and the rolling forth of the kingdom of God.

    The work of improvement is now actively begun, and in every
    direction may be heard the sound of the mason's trowel, the
    carpenter's hammer, the teamster's voice, or, in other words, the
    hum of industry and the voice of merriment. Indeed, to judge from
    the present appearance, a greater amount of improvement will be
    done the ensuing summer than in the preceding one.

    Almost every stranger that enters our city is excited with
    astonishment that so much has been done in so short a time; but
    we flatter ourselves, from the known industry, perseverance, and
    diligence of the Saints, that by the return of another winter so
    much more will be accomplished, that his astonishment will be
    increased to wonder and admiration.

    Quite extensive preparations are being made by the farmers in this
    vicinity for the cultivation of land; and should the season prove
    favorable, we doubt not that nearly, if not a sufficient amount of
    produce will be raised to supply the wants of the city and adjacent
    country.

    We are also pleased that we can inform our friends abroad that the
    Saints here of late have taken hold of the work on the Temple with
    the zeal and energy that in no small degree excites our admiration.
    Their united efforts certainly speak to us that it is their
    determination that this spacious edifice shall be enclosed, if not
    finished, this season.

    And a word we would say to the Saints abroad, which is, that the
    Temple is being built in compliance with a special commandment of
    God not to a few individuals, but to all. Therefore we sincerely
    hope you will contribute of your means as liberally as your
    circumstances will allow, that the burden of the work may not rest
    upon a few, but proportionately upon all.

    Where is the true-hearted Saint that does not with joy and delight
    contemplate the endowment of the servants of God and the blessings
    He has promised to His people on condition that they speedily
    build the Temple? Certainly you cannot reasonably expect to enjoy
    these blessings if you refuse to contribute your share towards its
    erection.

    It is a thing of importance, and much depends upon its
    accomplishment: therefore we wish to forcibly impress the matter
    upon your minds, hoping you will become aroused to a sense or
    your duty--that every company of Saints, every Elder that comes
    here, and every mail may bring money and other property for this
    important work,--which, {267} when completed, will stand, in one
    sense of the word, as a firm pillar in Zion, and which will greatly
    facilitate the prosperity of the great cause of truth which we all
    are actively engaged in.

_Saturday, 16.--_At home. At one p.m., I sat in council with Willard
Richards, Orrin P. Rockwell, and Bishop George Miller.

The Female Relief Society had two meetings in the assembly room, as it
would not hold all at once, and sanctioned the "Voice of Innocence from
Nauvoo."

[Sidenote: Wind Storm at Nauvoo.]

_Sunday, 17.--_Last night, Nauvoo was visited by a very strong wind
from the west. It blew down a portion of the west wall of the new hall
(28 by 40 feet on the ground,) which the Seventies had commenced on
Bain street, and they had raised for the roof.

The wind continued very strong all day. In the evening, had a smart
snowstorm, which covered the ground, was succeeded by a frosty night.

Attended prayer meeting.

_Monday, 18.--_The frost of last night was so severe as to form ice
inside the houses.

I stayed at home to recite German with Brother Neibaur.

_Tuesday, 19.--_Met in council in the assembly room. Elder Samuel Bent,
Uriah Brown, Samuel James, John D. Parker, Orrin P. Rockwell, Sidney
Rigdon, William Marks, and Orson Spencer met in council, in addition to
the former names.

In the afternoon, heavy, driving rain. Northwest wind. Dull, cold day.

_Wednesday, 20.--_Severely cold northwest wind, with a snow and hail
storm until ten a.m. Afternoon dull. West wind.

Spent the morning and afternoon in the assembly room, studying the
languages.

[Sidenote: Col. Copeland and the Vice-Presidency.]

{268} Elder Woodruff read me a letter which he had written to Colonel
Solomon Copeland concerning his nomination to be a candidate for the
Vice-President of the United States.

The _Illinois Springfield Register_ has the following:--

    GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.

    It appears by the Nauvoo papers that the Mormon Prophet is actually
    a candidate for the presidency. He has sent us his pamphlet,
    containing an extract of his principles, from which it appears
    that he is up to the hub for a United States bank and a protective
    tariff. On these points he is much more explicit than Mr. Clay,
    who will not say that he is for a bank, but talks all the time of
    restoring a national currency. Nor will Mr. Clay say what kind of a
    tariff he is for. He says to the south that he has not sufficiently
    examined the present tariff, but thinks very likely it could be
    amended.

    General Smith possesses no such fastidious delicacy. He comes right
    out in favor of a bank and a tariff, taking the true Whig ground,
    and ought to be regarded as the real Whig candidate for President,
    until Mr. Clay can so far recover from his shuffling and dodging as
    to declare his sentiments like a man.

    At present we can form no opinion of Clay's principles, except as
    they are professed by his friends in these parts.

    Clay himself has adopted the notion which was once entertained by
    an eminent grammarian, who denied that language was intended as a
    means to express one's ideas, but insisted that it was invented on
    purpose to aid us in concealing them.

The_ Iowa Democrat_ publishes the following:--

    _A New Candidate in the Field_.

    We see from the _Nauvoo Neighbor_ that General Joseph Smith,
    the great Mormon Prophet, has become a candidate for the next
    presidency. We do not know whether he intends to submit his claims
    to the National Convention, or not; but, judging from the language
    of his own organ, we conclude that he considers himself a full team
    for all of them.

    All that we have to say on this point is, that if superior talent,
    genius, and intelligence, combined with virtue, integrity, and
    enlarged views, are any guarantee to General Smith's being elected,
    we think that he will be a "full team of himself."

    {269} The _Missouri Republican_ believes that it will be death
    to Van Buren, and all agree that it must be injurious to the
    Democratic ranks, inasmuch as it will throw the Mormon vote out of
    the field.

    A traveler, having visited Nauvoo for a few days, wrote to the
    _Times and Seasons_--

    "Mr. Editor,--Before I take my departure, permit me to express my
    views relative to the leading men of your city, where I have been
    these few days.

    I have been conversant with the great men of the age; and, last of
    all I feel that I have met with the greatest, in the presence of
    your esteemed Prophet, General Joseph Smith. From many reports, I
    had reason to believe him a bigoted religionist, as ignorant of
    politics as the savages; but, to my utter astonishment, on the
    short acquaintance, I have found him as familiar in the cabinet of
    nations as with his Bible and in the knowledge of that book I have
    not met with his equal in Europe or America. Although I should beg
    leave to differ with him in some items of faith, his nobleness of
    soul will not permit him to take offense at me. No, sir; I find him
    open, frank, and generous,--as willing others should enjoy their
    opinions as to enjoy his own.

    The General appears perfectly at home on every subject, and his
    familiarity with many languages affords him ample means to become
    informed concerning all nations and principles, which with his
    familiar and dignified deportment towards all must secure to his
    interest the affections of every intelligent and virtuous man that
    may chance to fall in his way, and I am astonished that so little
    is known abroad concerning him.

    Van Buren was my favorite, and I was astonished to see General
    Smith's name as a competitor; but, since my late acquaintance, Mr.
    Van Buren can never re-seat himself in the Presidential chair on my
    vote while General Smith is in the field. Forming my opinions alone
    of the talents of the two, and from what I have seen, I have no
    reason to doubt but General Smith's integrity is equal to any other
    individual; and I am satisfied he cannot easily be made the pliant
    tool of any political party. I take him to be a man who stands far
    aloof from little caucus quibblings and squabblings, while nations,
    governments, and realms are wielded in his hand as familiarly as
    the top and hoop in the hands of their little masters.

    Free from all bigotry and superstition, he dives into every
    subject, and it seems as though the world was not large enough to
    satisfy his capacious soul, and from his conversation one might
    suppose him as well acquainted with other worlds as this.

    So far as I can discover, General Smith is the nation's man, and
    the man who will exalt the nation, if the people will give him the
    opportunity; {270} and all parties will find a friend in him so far
    as right is concerned.

    General Smith's movements are perfectly anomalous in the estimation
    of the public. All other great men have been considered wise in
    drawing around them wise men; but I have frequently heard the
    General called a fool because he has gathered the wisest of men
    to his cabinet, who direct his movements; but this subject is too
    ridiculous to dwell upon. Suffice it to say, so far as I have seen,
    he has wise men at his side--superlatively wise, and more capable
    of managing the affairs of a State than most men now engaged
    therein, which I consider much to his credit, though I would by no
    means speak diminutively of my old friend.

    From my brief acquaintance, I consider General Smith (independent
    of his peculiar religious views, in which by-the-by, I have
    discovered neither vanity nor folly,) the_ sine qua non_ of the
    age to our nation's prosperity. He has learned the all-important
    lesson "to profit by the experience of those who have gone before;"
    so that, in short, General Smith begins where other men leave off.
    I am aware this will appear a bold assertion to some; but I would
    say to such, call, and form your acquaintance, as I have done; then
    judge.

    Thus, sir, you have a few leading items of my views of General
    Smith, formed from personal acquaintance, which you are at liberty
    to dispose of as you think proper. I anticipate the pleasure of
    renewing my acquaintance with your citizens at a future day.

    Yours respectfully,

    A TRAVELER.

A writer in the _Quincy Herald_ reflects very strongly upon the conduct
of the _Quincy Whig, New York Tribune_, and other newspapers, for
publishing slanderous falsehoods against the Saints.

Ten, p.m., commenced snowing again.

[Sidenote: Origin of Memorial to Congress.]

_Thursday, 21.--_A cold snow-storm through the night.

In council in the assembly room, discussing the propriety of
petitioning Congress for the privilege of raising troops to protect the
making of settlements in the uncivilized portions of our continent.

Willard Richards was appointed a committee to draw up a memorial to
Congress.

{271} _Friday, 22.--_Snow on the ground; cold, bleak north wind; cloudy.

At ten a.m., held Mayor's court, and afterwards read German in the
reading room.

In the afternoon, met with the Twelve in prayer at President Brigham
Young's house.

[Sidenote: The Seventies' Hall, Instructions on Rebuilding.]

I advised the Seventies to pull down the remainder of the walls and
rebuild the Seventies' hall on a permanent basis from the foundation
and not erect for themselves a trap, but build one two stories high,
and strong enough to stand for a generation.

_Saturday, 23.--_Day warmer. Rode out with Clayton to endeavor to raise
money to furnish the hands in the Pinery with supplies. Visited the
Temple and public works.

Also called with William Clayton and Alexander Neibaur at Dr. Foster's.
He was gone to Appanoose, and Mrs. Foster was at Mr. Gilman's.

I here extract from William Clayton's journal:--

    _President Smith's Interview With Mrs. Foster_.

    We went down there and saw her, [Mrs. Foster]. President Joseph
    asked Sister Foster if she ever in her life knew him guilty of an
    immoral or indecent act. She answered, "No." He then explained
    his reasons for asking; which were, he had been informed that
    Dr. Foster had stated that Joseph made propositions to his wife
    calculated to lead her astray from the path of virtue; and then
    asked if ever he had used any indecent or insulting language to
    her. She answered, "Never." He further asked if he ever preached
    anything like the "plurality of wife" doctrine to her other than
    what he had preached in public? She said, "No." He asked her if he
    ever proposed to have illicit intercourse with her, and especially
    when he took dinner during the doctor's absence. She said, "No."
    After some further conversation on the subject, we left. Mrs.
    Gillman was present all the time. President Joseph and Neibaur then
    went on foot to the farm.

_Sunday, 24.--_At ten, a.m., met at the stand near the {272} Temple.
[The following very brief outline of the speeches is from the journal
of Wilford Woodruff]:--

    _Discourse of President Smith--Conspiracies in Nauvoo_.

    "President Joseph Smith addressed the people. The following is the
    substance of what I heard him say:--

    I have been informed by two gentlemen that a conspiracy is got
    up in this place for the purpose of taking the life of President
    Joseph Smith, his family, and all the Smith family, and the heads
    of the Church. One of the gentlemen will give his name to the
    public, and the other wishes it to be hid for the present: they
    will both testify to it on oath, and make an affidavit upon it. The
    names of the persons revealed at the head of the conspiracy are as
    follows:--Chancey L. Higbee, Dr. Robert D. Foster, Mr. Joseph H.
    Jackson, William and Wilson Law. And the lies that C. L. Higbee has
    hatched up as a foundation to work upon are--he says that I had
    men's heads cut off in Missouri, and that I had a sword run through
    the hearts of the people that I wanted to kill and put out of the
    way. I won't swear out a warrant against them, for I don't fear
    any of them: they would not scare off an old setting hen. I intend
    to publish all the iniquity that I know of them. If I am guilty, I
    am ready to bear it. There is sometimes honor among enemies. I am
    willing to do anything for the good of the people. I will give the
    name of one of the gentlemen who have divulged the plot: his name
    is M. G. Eaton. He will swear to it: he is a bold fellow. Joseph H.
    Jackson said a Smith should not be alive in two weeks,--not over
    two months anyhow. Concerning the character of these men, I will
    say nothing about it now; but if I hear anything more from them on
    this subject, I will tell what I know about them.

    _Elder Orson Spencer_ addressed the people as follows:--

    While listening to President Smith's remarks, I thought of a
    figure, i.e., if a physician was going to dissect a body, he would
    not be likely to begin at the limbs but cut the head off first. So
    the adversary of the Saints has laid a plan to cut off the head
    of the Church with the intention of scattering and destroying the
    whole body. It was so in the days of Jesus Christ; the enemies of
    the truth sought to kill Him, that the body might be destroyed;
    which was also the case in the days of Elijah, Daniel, and many of
    the ancients.

    I once heard a man say, who was opposed to this work, "That it
    might be true, but it gave Joseph Smith power." True, said I; but
    if his power be subordinate to the power of God, it is right. If
    a man set up a kingdom by the power of God, then let others seek
    power from the same source. God sets up kingdoms and pulls down
    kingdoms: {273} this makes men mad who will not submit to the
    kingdom of God. We all know the result of the power of Moses, who
    was the representative of God.

    Judging from what is past, how will it be when God sets up His
    kingdom in the last days? Whether there is a conspiracy now, or
    not, I don't know; but no doubt there will be, if not now, for it
    has always been so. In the days of the Nephites, they had their
    Gadianton robbers. I have not any doubt but that the apostates will
    join with the other wicked powers to try to put down the power of
    God, and I am glad to have the power of the kingdom of God tested;
    I care not what sacrifice I am called to make for such a kingdom.
    If it is friends, wealth, or even life, at the purchase of such
    a kingdom, it is cheap. Did the ancient Apostles, Prophets, or
    Saints who died pay too much for that kingdom? They did not. It
    is necessary that men be put in possession of the knowledge and
    mysteries of the kingdom of God, in order to sin as far as they
    wish, that they may go to the highest pitch. How often men lay down
    their lives for their country and other purposes. How much better,
    then, to die for the cause of Zion! Good and righteous men will
    administer justice and rebuke evil. The Church should be cleansed
    from bad men, and the Lord will take His own way to cleanse the
    Church.

    We should lift up our voice against wickedness of all kinds. But
    will the rulers of our land do it? No, they will not; they will
    be cowards until there is no man to fight, and then be brave.
    When Government will not do it, some man should take the helm of
    government that will do it. Will it be called treason, if the God
    of heaven should set up a kingdom? May the Lord give you more and
    more of His Spirit, light and intelligence, until you are cemented
    together in union and love. Amen.

    Elder Sidney Rigdon addressed the meeting.

    President Joseph Smith again arose and said--In relation to the
    power over the minds of mankind which I hold, I would say, It is
    in consequence of the power of truth in the doctrines which I have
    been an instrument in the hands of God of presenting unto them, and
    not because of any compulsion on my part. I wish to ask if ever I
    got any of it unfairly? If I have not reproved you in the gate? I
    ask, Did I ever exercise any compulsion over any man? Did I not
    give him the liberty of disbelieving any doctrine I have preached,
    if he saw fit? Why do not my enemies strike a blow at the doctrine?
    They cannot do it: it is truth, and I defy all men to upset it. I
    am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Repent ye of your
    sins and prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man; for the
    kingdom of God has come unto you, {274} and henceforth the ax is
    laid unto the root of the tree; and every tree that bringeth not
    forth good fruit, God Almighty (and not Joe Smith) shall hew it
    down and cast it into the fire."

After meeting, I rode out with Emma. The trees begin to bud forth.

In the evening, held a conversation with a large company of friends at
my door.

Elder R. H. Kinnamon writes that during the last 22 months he has
baptized over 100 persons while on a mission in Virginia and North
Carolina, organized two branches in Virginia, and calls are continually
made for preaching in every direction.

[Sidenote: Progress on Memorial to Congress.]

_Monday, 25.--_At home in the morning. After dinner rode up to the
upper landing to see the _St. Louis Oak_ steamer. Learned that a
company of emigrants from England were expected soon. Called at my
office on returning, and heard read the draft of a memorial to Congress
which my clerk had been writing, as a committee appointed by the
council on Thursday last, and was pleased with the instrument.

Millions of wild pigeons flying north, and millions of gnats dancing in
the air. Dull day. At night thunder, lightning and rain.

_Tuesday, 26.--_Dull day. From nine to twelve, noon, in council; also
from two to five p.m.

The memorial drawn up by Dr. Richards was read, discussed, and approved
by the general council.

Started this morning to go to Ramus with Brother Amasa Lyman. Rode as
far as the Temple, and found it so muddy that we turned back.

    _To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the
    United States of America, in Congress Assembled_:

    Your memorialist, a tree-born citizen or these United States,
    respectfully showeth that from his infancy his soul has been filled
    with the most intense and philanthropic interest for the welfare
    of his native country; and being fired with an ardor which floods
    cannot quench, crowns cannot conquer, nor diplomatic intrigue
    corrupt, to see those principles which emanated from the bosoms of
    the fathers of seventy-six, and which cost the noblest talents and
    richest blood of the nation, maintained inviolate and perpetuated
    to future generations; and the proud eagle of American freedom
    soar triumphant over every party prejudice and local sinistry, and
    spread her golden pinions over every member of the human family,
    who shall stretch forth their hands for succor from the lion's
    paw or the oppressor's grasp; and firmly trusting in the God of
    liberty, that He has designed universal peace and goodwill, union,
    and brotherly love to all the great family of man, your memorialist
    asks your honorable body to pass the following:--

    ORDINANCE.

    _An Ordinance for the Protection of the Citizens of the United
    States Emigrating to the Territories, and for the Extension of the
    Principles of Universal Liberty_.

    PREAMBLE.

    Whereas, many of the citizens of these United States have migrated
    and are migrating to Texas, Oregon, and other lands contiguous to
    this nation; _and whereas,_ Texas has declared herself free and
    independent, without the necessary power to protect her rights
    and liberties; _and whereas_ Oregon is without any organized
    government, and those who emigrate thither are exposed to
    foreign invasion and domestic feuds; _and whereas_ the Oregon,
    by geographical location and discovery more rightfully belongs
    to these United States than any other general government; _and
    whereas_ it is necessary that the emigrants of that newly settling
    territory should receive protection; _and whereas_ the Texan
    Government has petitioned the United States to be received into our
    Union, but yet retains her national existence; _and whereas_ the
    United States remember with gratitude the seasonable support they
    received in alike situation from a LaFayette_; and whereas_ the
    United States desire to see the principles of her free institutions
    extended to all men, especially {276} where it can be done without
    the loss of blood and treasure to the nation_; and whereas_ there
    is an almost boundless extent of territory on the west and south
    of these United States, where exists little or no organization
    of protective Government; _and whereas_ the lands thus unknown;
    unowned, or unoccupied, are among some of the richest and most
    fertile of the continent; _and whereas_ many of the inhabitants of
    the Union would gladly embrace the opportunity of extending their
    researches and acquirements so soon as they can receive protection
    in their enterprise, thereby adding strength, durability, and
    wealth to the nation; _and whereas_ the red man, the robber,
    and the desperado have frequently interrupted such research and
    acquisition without justifiable cause; _and whereas_ Joseph Smith
    has offered and does hereby offer these United States, to show
    his loyalty to our Confederate Union and the Constitution of our
    Republic; to prevent quarrel and bloodshed our frontiers; to extend
    the arm of deliverance to Texas; to on protect the inhabitants of
    Oregon from foreign aggressions and domestic broils; to prevent
    the crowned nations from encircling us as a nation on our western
    and southern borders, and save the eagle's talon from the lion's
    paw; to still the tongue of slander, and show the world that a
    Republic can be, and not be ungrateful; to open the vast regions of
    the unpeopled west and south to our enlightened and enterprising
    yeomanry; to protect them in their researches; to secure them in
    their locations, and thus strengthen the Government and enlarge
    her borders; to extend her influence; to inspire the nations with
    the spirit of freedom and win them to her standard; to promote
    intelligence; to cultivate and establish peace among all with
    whom we may have intercourse as neighbors; to settle all existing
    difficulties among those not organized into an acknowledged
    government bordering upon the United States and Territories; to
    save the national revenue in the nation's coffers; to supercede
    the necessity of a standing army on our western and southern
    frontiers; to create and maintain the principles of peace and
    suppress mobs, insurrections, and oppression in Oregon and all the
    lands bordering upon the United States and not incorporated into
    any acknowledged national government; to explore the unexplored
    regions of our continent; to open new fields for enterprise to our
    citizens, and protect them therein; to search out the antiquities
    of the land, and thereby promote the arts and sciences, and general
    information; to amalgamate the feelings of all with whom he may
    have intercourse on the principles of equity, liberty, justice,
    humanity and benevolence; to break down tyranny and oppression
    and exalt the standard of universal peace, provided he shall be
    protected in those rights and privileges which constitutionally
    belong to every citizen of this Republic; therefore, that the said
    memorialist may {277} have the privilege, and that no citizen of
    the United States shall obstruct, or attempt to obstruct or hinder,
    so good, so great, so noble an enterprise to carry out those plans
    and principles as set forth in this preamble, and be shielded from
    every opposition by evil and designing men.

    Section 1. _Be it ordained by the Senate and House of
    Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress
    Assembled,_ that Joseph Smith, of the city of Nauvoo, in the State
    of Illinois, is hereby authorized and empowered to raise a company
    of one hundred thousand armed volunteers in the United States and
    Territories, at such times, and places and in such numbers, as he
    shall find necessary and convenient for the purposes specified in
    the foregoing preamble, and to execute the same.

    Sec. 2. _And be it further ordained_ that if any person or persons
    shall hinder or attempt to hinder or molest the said Joseph Smith
    from executing his designs in raising said volunteers, and marching
    and transporting the same to the borders of the United States and
    Territories, he, or they so hindering, molesting, or offending,
    shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars
    each for every offense, or by hard labor on some public work not
    exceeding two years, or both, at the discretion of the nearest
    District Court of the United States, where the hindrance or offense
    shall be committed, having jurisdiction.

    Sec. 3. _And be it further ordained,_ the more fully to remove
    all obstructions and hindrances to the raising, enlisting, and
    marching the volunteers as aforesaid, the said Joseph Smith is
    hereby constituted a member of the army of these United States, and
    is authorized to act as such in the United States and Territories,
    and on all lands bordering upon the United States and Territories,
    for the purposes specified in the foregoing preamble, provided
    said land shall not be within the acknowledged jurisdiction of any
    acknowledged national government.

    Sec. 4._ And be it further ordained_ that nothing in this ordinance
    shall be so construed by any individual or nation to consider
    the volunteers aforesaid as constituting any part of the army
    of the United States; neither shall the said Joseph Smith, as a
    member of the United States army, disturb the peace of any nation
    or government acknowledged as such, break the faith of treaties
    between the United States and any other nation, or violate any
    known law of nations, thereby endangering the peace of the United
    States.

    Sec. 5. _And be it further ordained,_ that the said Joseph Smith
    shall confine his operations to those principles of action
    specified in the preamble to this ordinance, the perpetuity
    of which shall be commensurate with the circumstances and
    specifications which have originated it.

    And your memorialist will ever pray, &c.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, March 26, 1844.

{278} Dr. Willard Richards wrote to the Saints at Augusta, Lee County,
Iowa, requesting a brief history of the settling of that branch, and
also asking a donation of lumber for his house.

In the afternoon, Abiathar B. Williams made the following affidavit
before Daniel H. Wells, Esq:--

    _Affidavit of Abiathar B. Williams, Concerning a Conspiracy against
    the Prophet_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY, ss.

    Personally appeared before me, Daniel H. Wells, Acting Justice of
    the Peace in and for the said county, Abiathar B. Williams, who
    being duly sworn according to law, deposeth and saith that on or
    about the 15th day of March, A. D., 1844, Joseph H. Jackson came to
    my house and requested me to walk with him; which I did. During the
    time we were walking, said Joseph H. Jackson said that he was then
    coming direct from Mr. Law's; that there was going to be a secret
    meeting in the city of Nauvoo, probably tomorrow evening: but, as
    it was not decided, he could not say positively as to the time; but
    he would inform me in season. The said Joseph H. Jackson said that
    Doctor Foster, Chauncey L. Higbee, and the Laws were red hot for a
    conspiracy, and he should not be surprised if in two weeks there
    should not be one of the Smith family left alive in Nauvoo. After
    we arrived at Mr. Loomis', near the Masonic hall, in the city of
    Nauvoo, he related some things which he stated that Dr. Foster had
    said relative to his family. This he did in the presence of Mr.
    Eaton and myself, and strongly solicited myself and Mr. Eaton to
    attend the secret meeting and join them in their intentions. The
    said Joseph H. Jackson further said that Chauncey Higbee had said
    that he, the said Chauncey Higbee, had seen men tied hand and foot,
    and run through the heart with a sword, and their heads taken off,
    and then buried; and he durst not say a word. This the said Jackson
    said in Mr. Loomis' room. And further this deponent saith not.

    DANIEL H. WELLS, J. P.

Also M. G. Eaton made affidavit as follows:--

    {279} _Affidavit of M. G. Eaton--A conspiracy Against Joseph Smith_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY, ss.

    Personally appeared before me, Daniel H. Wells, an acting Justice
    of the Peace, in and for the said county, M. G. Eaton, who being
    duly sworn according to law, deposeth and saith that on or about
    the fifteenth day of March, A. D. 1844, Joseph H. Jackson came to
    me several times and requested me to go on the hill with him. I
    finally consented went with him to the Keystone Store, in the city
    of Nauvoo. Dr. Foster and one of the Higbees (I think Chauncey L.
    Higbee) were in the store. The said Joseph H. Jackson, together
    with the said R. D. Foster and said Higbee, went into the back room
    of the store. They appeared to enter into private council. Soon
    after they went into the said room, the said Joseph H. Jackson
    invited me into the room where they were sitting. I immediately
    complied.

    Soon after I went in, the said Higbee commenced talking about the
    spiritual wife system. He said he had no doubt but some of the
    Elders had ten or twelve apiece. He said they married them, whether
    the females were living or not; and they did it by recording the
    marriage in a large book, which book was sealed up after the record
    was made, and was not to be opened for a long time,--probably not
    till many of the husbands of those who were thus married were dead.
    They would then open the book and break the seals in the presence
    of those females, and when they saw their names recorded in that
    book they would believe that the doctrine was true and they must
    submit. He said this book was kept at Mr. Hyrum Smith's. I asked
    the Chauncey L Higbee. * * * * *

    [Here follows some expressions too indecent for insertion.]

    The aforesaid R. D. Foster then asked me what I would think, if,
    during my absence from home, a carriage should drive up to my
    house, a person alight, and the carriage then drive off again; this
    person should then go into my house and begin to tell my wife a
    great many things against me to prejudice her mind against me, and
    use every possible means to do this, and finally would introduce
    and preach the spiritual wife doctrine to her, and make an attempt
    to seduce her; and further, this person should sit down to dine
    with my wife, bless the victuals, &c.; and while they were thus
    engaged, I should come home and find them thus associated, this
    person should rise up and say, "How do you do?" and bless me in a
    very polite manner, &c.; and also if, upon these appearances, I
    should feel jealous that something was wrong, and when the person
    was {280} gone I would ask my wife what had been the conversation
    between her and this person, but she would refuse to tell me; I
    then draw a pistol and present it to her head and threaten to shoot
    her if she did not tell me all, but she would still refuse: I then
    would give her a double-barrelled pistol, and say to her, "Defend
    yourself; for if you don't tell me, either you or I would shoot"
    she would then faint away through fear and excitement, and when she
    came to again, she would begin and tell how this person had been
    trying to poison your wife's mind against you, and, by preaching
    the spiritual wife system to her, had endeavored to seduce her. I
    replied, I should think he was a rascal: but who has had such a
    trial as that? The said R. D. Foster answered that he was the man
    who had had that trial, and who had been thus abused.

    The said Dr. Foster, Higbee, and Joseph H. Jackson then remarked
    that they were about to hold a secret meeting to oppose and try to
    put a stop to such things. The said Joseph H. Jackson also said
    that if any person undertook to arrest him, he should begin to cut
    them.

    The said R. D. Foster further said he was afraid of his life, and
    dared not be out at nights.

    The said Higbee said he had not a doubt but there had been men
    killed in Missouri who had secrets that they were afraid they would
    divulge. He said he was afraid of his life.

    The said Jackson further said he should not be surprised if there
    should be a real muss and an insurrection in the city in less
    than two months; and that if a disturbance should take place, the
    Carthaginians and others would come and help them.

    He mentioned some names of persons who would come from Carthage,
    which names I do not remember. The same day, when in Mr. Loomis'
    room, I heard the said Jackson say that the Laws were ready to
    enter into a secret conspiracy, tooth and nails.

    The said Higbee also said, while at the Keystone Store, that if
    ever he was brought before the Mayor's court again, and the Mayor
    told him to hold his tongue, he should get up and tell him he had a
    right to speak, and should do so; and then if any man attempted to
    put him out of court, he would shoot him through. And further this
    deponent saith not.

[Sidenote: The Robbery at Rollasson's Store in Nauvoo.]

_Saturday, 30.--_This morning I heard there was some disturbance on the
hill; I rode up and found it reported that a robbery had been committed
at the Keystone Store, kept by Mr. Rollasson, of some $400 or $500, and
some goods, and they were suspicious of a certain black man. I issued a
search-warrant and returned to my office, where I found the black man,
-- Chism, with his back lacerated from his shoulders to his hips, with
twenty or more lashes. My clerk, Dr. Richards, kept him secreted, and
called Aaron Johnson, a justice of the peace, who issued a warrant for
-- --, a Missourian, who had boarded at my house a few days, and on
testimony fined him $5 and costs for whipping -- Chism. One Easton, a
witness, said he could not testify without implicating himself, and he
was apprehended and held in custody. W. H. J. Marr, Esq., refused to
testify, because he was counsel.

[Sidenote: Memorial to the President of the United States.]

I got prepared a memorial to his Excellency John Tyler, {282} the
President of the United States, embodying in it the same sentiments as
are in my Petition to the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States, dated 26th March, 1844, asking the privilege of raising
100,000 men to extend protection to persons wishing to settle Oregon
and other portions of the territory of the United States, and extend
protection to the people in Texas.

_Sunday, 31.--_Cold, fine day.

At home this morning until nine, when I went over to my reading-room,
again heard read and signed my memorial to Congress for the privilege
of raising 100,000 volunteers to protect Texas, Oregon, &c., dated 26th
instant; and also a memorial to the President for the same purpose, if
the other fail.

Also signed an introductory letter to Elder Orson Hyde, who is going to
carry the memorials [2] to Washington as follows:--

    {283} _"Credentials of Orson Hyde, Agent to Present the Prophet's
    Memorial to Congress_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, March 30, 1844.

    _To whom it may concern:_ We, the Mayor and Recorder of said city,
    do certify that Orson Hyde, Esq. the bearer, a Councilor in the
    City Council of said city, is sent as our agent, by the authorities
    of said city, to transact such business as he may deem expedient
    and beneficial for the party whom he represents; and such agent
    and gentleman of principle and character, he by us is recommended
    to the due consideration of all the executive officers of the
    Government, both houses of Congress, and gentlemen generally of the
    United States.

    In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and affixed the
    seal of said corporation at the time and place aforesaid.

    [CORPORATION SEAL.]

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, Recorder.

About this time, Brother Alexander Mills, one of the police, informed
me that Chauncey L. Higbee drew a pistol on him the night before, and
threatened to shoot him. I instructed him to make complaint to Esquire
Wells, and have him apprehended.

Footnotes:

1. In addition to these affidavits the Prophet was apprised by two
young men Denison L. Harris and Robert Scott, the latter living in the
family of William Law, of a secret movement then on foot to take his
life, and the lives of several other leading men in the Church, among
them the Prophet's brother, Hyrum. These young men were invited to
the secret meetings by the conspirators, but before going conferred
with the Prophet, who told them to go, but to take no part in the
proceedings of these wicked men against himself. They carried out
his instructions, and at the risk of their lives attended the secret
meetings three times, and brought to President Smith a report of what
they had witnessed. A full account of this conspiracy written by
Horace Cummings--the narrative being detailed to him by Dennison L.
Harris--was published in the _Contributor,_ for April, 1884.

2. President Smith's memorial to Congress, of the 26th of March,
asking to be appointed "a member of the army of these United States,"
to be authorized "to raise 100,000 armed volunteers" to police the
inter-mountain and Pacific slope west, was presented to the House of
Representatives by Mr. John Wentworth, of Chicago, where the following
occurred with reference to it:

MORMONS:

"Mr. Wentworth asked permission to present a memorial from Gen. Joseph
Smith, the head of the Mormons, and required that it might be read by
the clerk for the information of the House.

"The clerk commenced the reading of the memorial.

"Before the reading was concluded.

"Mr. J. R. Ingersoll interposed, and objected a the reception at first,
and still objected.

"Mr. Weber observed that if memorials of this kind were to be read, he
was entrusted with the presentation of one of a peculiar character,
from certain city of Frederick county, Md.

"Mr. Wentworth said he would move a suspension of the rules to enable
him to have the paper read; and he wished a inquire of the chair
whether it would be in order for him to assign him reasons for making
such a motion.

"Mr. Duncan observed, if the gentleman would yield him the floor, he
would move to suspend the rules, to go into committee of the whole on
the Oregon bill.

"Mr. Wentworth said that, as he had the floor, he would make the
motion. Mr. Wentworth then moved that the rules be suspended, for the
purpose of going into committee of the whole on the Oregon Bill.

"The Speaker said that the question would be put on suspending the
rules to go into committee of the whole. If that motion prevailed, the
gentleman could move to take up any bill he pleased.

"Mr. Vance called for the yeas and nays on the question; which were
ordered.

"Mr. McKay inquired if the House should refuse to go into committee of
the whole, if it could by postponement of the previous orders, take up
the naval appropriation bill which had been reported from the committee
of the whole.

"The speaker said a motion to that effect would require a vote of
two-thirds.

"The question was put on suspending the rules and rejected--yeas 79,
nays 86." ("Congressional Globe" for May 25th, 1844. Vol. 13, No. 39,

CHAPTER XII.

THE AUTHORITIES OF NAUVOO VS. THE HIGBEES, ET. AL--DEDICATION OF
THE MASONIC HALL--THE CHURCH CONFERENCE OF APRIL, 1844--ADDRESS OF
PRESIDENT SIDNEY RIGDON; DITTO PATRIARCH HYRUM SMITH--HISTORICAL
RESUME, AND BUILDING THE TEMPLE.

_Monday, April 1, 1844.--_In the court-room in the Mansion, Mr. J.
Easton was brought up as being accessory to whipping Chism, [a negro].
Referred the case to Alderman Wells. On investigation, it appeared to
the satisfaction of the court that he had been on trial for the same
offense before Robert D. Foster, and acquitted.

I extract from the _Neighbor_:--

    _Comment on the Negro Chism's Case_.

    After the court dismissed the case, General Smith fearlessly stated
    that he believed that it was a plot on the part of those who were
    instrumental in getting up the previous trial to thwart the ends
    of justice and screen the prisoner from the condemnation he justly
    deserves. Mr. Foster then stated, by way of an apology, that at the
    time he issued the warrant he did not know that the prisoner was
    under an arrest, or that there was any process out against him.

    We hope, for the honor of such a man as Mr. Foster, that his
    statement is true. Mr. Foster, however, called upon one of his
    jurors, Mr. Carn, to corroborate what he had said; but, to our
    astonishment, be replied that when Mr. Foster summoned him to
    appear and act as a juryman, he was not informed what case he was
    to act upon, nor did he learn until he entered the office, where he
    acted according to the evidence given; but believed then, as well
    as now, that it was a sham trial, and a mere mockery of justice. We
    state facts as they are, and let the public judge for themselves.

    {285} The statement of the negro was that Messrs. Easton,
    Townsend, and Lawyer W. H. J. Marr were the persons engaged in
    this diabolical affair. Mr. Gibbs, one of the witnesses against
    Townsend, believed the above persons were engaged in it; but as
    a negro knows nothing in this state, and Mr. Gibbs could not
    positively swear to it, of course we don't know; but we have our
    opinion, and so have the public. We don't remember ever having seen
    more indignation manifest than was manifested on this occasion,
    and the public mind is not satisfied at the turn affairs have
    taken. Lynch law will not do in Nauvoo, and those who engage in
    it must expect to be visited by the wrath of an indignant people,
    not according to the rule of Judge Lynch, but according to law and
    equity.

It was thought best to acquit Easton and leave the case to the Circuit
Court.

[Sidenote: The Higbee Brothers in Trouble.]

Francis M. Higbee and Chauncey L. Higbee were brought up before Esquire
Wells for assaulting the police, and acquitted. Chauncey L. Higbee
a lawyer, was brought before Daniel H. Wells Esq., on the charge of
using abusive language to and insulting the city marshal while in the
discharge of his official duty. He was fined ten dollars.

Also Robert D. Foster, Esq., was taken before Isaac Higbee, J. P.,
and fined ten dollars, for a breach of the ordinance pertaining to
gambling, &c.

We are sorry to find that our lawyers and magistrates should be taking
the lead among gamblers and disorderly persons, and be numbered among
the law-breakers, rather than supporting virtue, law, and the dignity
of the city.

[Sidenote: Counter move of the Higbees.]

_Tuesday, 2.--_At home, somewhat unwell, and kept my house this fine
day. John P. Greene, marshal; Andrew Lytle, and John Lytle, policemen,
were arrested by a warrant issued by Robert D. Foster, on complaint
of Francis M. Higbee, for false imprisonment. As the case was going
to trial, the prisoners were taken by John D. Parker, with a writ of_
habeas corpus_ before the Municipal Court; and tomorrow, at one, p.m.,
was fixed for trial.

{286} _Wednesday, 3.--_At one, p.m., presided in a special session of
the Municipal Court, with Aldermen William Marks, Newel K. Whitney,
Orson Spencer, George W. Harris, Gustavus Hills, George A. Smith, and
Samuel Bennett as Associate-Justices. John P. Greene, Andrew Lytle, and
John Lytle were brought up on _habeas corpus_ having been taken from
the officer who held them on a writ issued by Robert D. Foster, before
whom they had been arraigned on the complaint of Chauncey L. Higbee,
charged with false imprisonment.

Joel S. Miles, Andrew Lytle, John Lytle, John P. Greene, and Robert D.
Foster were sworn, gave testimony in the case, and the court decided
that Greene and the two Lytles be discharged, and that Chauncey L.
Higbee is a very disorderly person; that this case on _habeas corpus_
originated in a malicious and vexatious suit, instituted by Chauncey L.
Higbee against the petitioners now discharged; and that said Higbee pay

Warm and cloudy.

[Sidenote: Conference in New York.]

A conference was held in the city of New York; Elder William Smith
presiding, and Elder William H. Miles, clerk. Fifteen branches were
represented, containing 566 members, including 3 High Priests, 26
Elders, 15 Priests, 16 Teachers, and 9 Deacons.

_Thursday, 14.--_In a general council in the assembly room from nine to
twelve, a.m., and from one to four, p.m.

I was visited by eleven Indians, who wanted counsel, and had an
impressive interview.

Elder Orson Hyde was in the council, and left immediately for
Washington. [1]

{287} A company of Saints arrived on the steamer _St. Croix_.

Showery day.

[Sidenote: Dedication Masonic Temple.]

_Friday, 5.--_Attended the dedication of the Masonic Temple, which
was attended by about 550 members of the Masonic fraternity from
various parts of the world. A procession was formed at Henry Miller's
house, and was accompanied by the Nauvoo Brass Band to the hall. The
dedicatory ceremonies were performed by the Worshipful Master Hyrum
Smith. Elder Erastus Snow delivered an able Masonic address. Dr.
Goforth and I also addressed the assembly. All the visiting Masons were
furnished a dinner at the Masonic Hall at the expense of the Nauvoo
Lodge. The building is admitted to be the most substantial and best
finished Masonic Temple in the Western States. It has been erected
under the direction of Mr. Lucius N. Scovil.

In consequence of ill health, I deferred preaching the funeral sermon
of King Follett until Sunday. Elder Amasa Lyman addressed a very large
assembly at the stand.

    _General Conference Minutes of the Church, April, 1844_.

    Conference met pursuant to adjournment. Present--President Joseph
    Smith, Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and William Marks. Of the
    Twelve--Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Willard Richards, Wilford
    Woodruff, John Taylor, and George A. Smith.

    The members of the High Council, an immense number of Elders, an a
    very large concourse of people.

    Presidents Joseph and Hyrum Smith came to the stand at a quarter
    past ten o'clock, when the meeting was called to order by Elder
    Brigham Young. The choir sang a hymn, after which

    _Opening Address of President Joseph Smith_.

    President Joseph Smith rose to state to the congregation the
    nature of the business which would have to come before them.
    He stated that it had been expected by some that the little
    petty difficulties which have existed would be brought up and
    investigated before this conference, but {288} it will not be
    the case: these things are of too trivial a nature to occupy the
    attention of so large a body. I intend to give you some instruction
    on the principles of eternal truth, but will defer it until others
    have spoken, in consequence of the weakness of my lungs. The
    Elders will give you instruction; and then, if necessary, I will
    offer such corrections as may be proper to all up the interstices.
    Those who feel desirous of sowing the seeds of discord will be
    disappointed on this occasion. It is our purpose to build up and
    establish the principles of righteousness, and not to break down
    and destroy. The Great Jehovah has ever been with me, and the
    wisdom of God will direct me in the seventh hour. I feel in closer
    communion and better standing with God than ever I felt before in
    my life, and I am glad of this opportunity to appear in your midst.
    I thank God for the glorious day that He has given us. In so large
    a congregation it is necessary that the greatest order and decorum
    be observed. I request this at your hands, and believe that you
    will all keep good order.

    Prayer was offered by W. W. Phelps, after which the choir sang a
    hymn.

    _Elder Sidney Rigdon_.

    Elder Sidney Rigdon then rose and said: It is with no ordinary
    degree of satisfaction I enjoy this privilege this morning. Want
    of health and other circumstances have kept me in silence for
    nearly the last five years. It can hardly be expected that when
    the violence of sickness has used its influence, and the seeds
    of disease have so long preyed upon me, that I can rise before
    this congregation, only in weakness. I am now come forth from
    a bed of sickness, and have enough of strength left to appear
    here for the first time in my true character. I have not come
    before a conference for the last five years in my true character.
    I shall consider this important privilege sacred in my family
    history during life. I hardly promise myself lungs to make this
    congregation hear me. I shall do the best I can, and the greatest
    can do no more.

    The circumstance by which we are now surrounded point out the
    principles of my discourse--the history of this Church, which I
    have known from its infancy. My text is--"Behold the Church of God
    of the last days." I do not know that I can find it in the Bible.
    I do not think it necessary to have Paul to make a text for me;
    I can make a text for myself. I recollect in the year 1830 I met
    the whole Church of Christ in a little old log-house about 20 feet
    square, near Waterloo, N.Y., and we began to talk about the kingdom
    of God as if we had the world at our command. We talked with great
    confidence, and {289} talked big things. Although we were not many
    people, we had big feelings.

    We knew fourteen years ago that the Church would become as large
    as it is today. We were as big then as we ever shall be. We began
    to talk like men in authority and power. We looked upon the men of
    the earth as grasshoppers. If we did not see this people, we saw
    by vision the Church of God, a thousand times larger. And when men
    would say we wanted to upset the Government, although we were not
    enough to well man a farm, or meet a woman with a milk-pail, all
    the Elders, all the members met in conference in a room twenty feet
    square.

    I recollect Elder Phelps being put in jail for reading the Book of
    Mormon. He came to see us, and expressed great astonishment, and
    left us, apparently pondering in his heart. He afterwards came to
    Kirtland, Ohio, and said he was a convert. Many things were taught,
    believed, and preached then, which have since come to pass. We knew
    the whole world would laugh at us; so we concealed ourselves, and
    there was much excitement about our secret meetings, charging us
    with designs against the Government, and with laying plans to get
    money, &c., which never existed in the hearts of any one else [_i.
    e._, but in the hearts of their accusers]. And if we had talked in
    public, we should have been ridiculed more than we were. The world,
    being entirely ignorant of the testimony of the Prophets, and
    without knowledge of what God was about to do, treated all we said
    with pretended contempt and much ridicule, and had they heard all
    we said, it would have made worse for us.

    We talked about the people coming as doves to the windows; and that
    nations should flock unto it; that they should come bending to the
    standard of Jesus, saying, "Our fathers have taught falsehoods and
    things in which there is no profit," and of whole nations being
    born in one day. We talked such big things that men could not bear
    them, and they not only ridiculed us for what we did say in public,
    but threatened and inflicted much personal abuse; and if they had
    heard all we said, their violence would have been insupportable.
    God had great things to say for the salvation of the world, which,
    if they had been told the public, would have brought persecution
    upon us unto death: so we were obliged to retire to our secret
    chamber and commune ourselves with God. If we had told the people
    what our eyes behold this day, we should not have been believed;
    but the rascals would have shed our blood if we had only told them
    what we believed. There we sat in secret and beheld the glorious
    visions and powers of the kingdom of heaven pass and repass. We had
    not a mighty congregation to shelter us. If a mob came upon us, we
    had to run and hide ourselves to save our lives.

    {290} The time has now come to tell why we held secret meetings. We
    were maturing plans fourteen years ago which we can now tell. Were
    we maturing plans to corrupt the world, to destroy the peace of
    society? No. Let fourteen years' experience of the Church tell the
    story. The Church never would have been here if we had not done as
    we did in secret. The cry of "False prophet and imposter!" rolled
    upon us. I do not know that anything has taken place in the history
    of this Church which we did not then believe. It was written
    upon our hearts and never could be taken away. It was indelibly
    engraved; no power beneath yonder heavens could obliterate it. This
    was the period when God laid the foundation of the Church, and He
    laid it firmly, truly, and upon eternal truth.

    If any man says it is not the work of God, I know he lies. Some of
    you who know you have a house, how long would it take to make you
    reason yourselves into a belief that you have no house where you
    now reside with your family? Neither have we any power whereby we
    can ever persuade ourselves that this is not the Church of God. We
    do not care who sinks or swims, or opposes, but we know here is
    the Church of God, and I have authority before God for saying so.
    I have the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy. I
    have slept with it,--I have walked with it. The idea has never been
    out of my heart for a moment, and I will reap the glory of it when
    I leave this world. I defy men and hell and devils to put it out of
    my heart. I defy all, and will triumph in spite of them.

    I know God. I have gazed upon the glory of God, the throne, visions
    and glories of God, and the visions of eternity in days gone by.
    What is a man of God to do, when he sees all the madness, wrath and
    follies of our persecutors? He will do as God does--he will sit and
    laugh. * * * These were the beginning of good days--shut up in a
    room eating nothing but dry johnny-cake and buttermilk. Every man
    who had a little farm or clothes, sold them and distributed what he
    had among the rest, and did the best he could. I had a little to
    eat--little to wear, and yet it was the beginning of good days.

    Some say "I want plenty to eat, plenty to drink, plenty to wear,
    and a good house to live in;" and, say they, then I will believe. But
    God will not give it until you have proved yourselves unto Him.

    No wonder, then, that we should be joyful today. If the people will
    do as they are told, I will tell you what to do. Get the visions
    of heaven, and seek not what you shall eat or what you shall
    drink, but seek the will of God. Get into the presence of God, and
    then you will have johnny-cake and milk-and-water no more. Would
    you not be astonished if even now we should tell the glories and
    privileges of the Saints of God to you and to the world? We should
    be ridiculed; and {291} no wonder we shut it up in secret. If we
    were to tell you when Jehovah is looked upon, lo it is beauty, it
    is heaven, it is felicity to look upon Jehovah. I should marvel if
    it were otherwise. If a man tells you one glory or one message, he
    is learning another at the same time. Do not be astonished, then,
    if we even yet have secret meetings, asking God for things for your
    benefit.

    Do not be afraid. Go back to the commencement of this Church, and
    see what was concocted then. There was no evil concocted when
    we first held secret meetings, and it is the same now. Has God
    forgotten to be gracious, to be merciful to mankind? Did He ever
    concoct anything that was devilish for mankind? He could not do it.
    I never am afraid of God or man concocting anything to hurt me.
    I have faith to detect men, even if they did. I would ask God to
    detect them, and hold them fast before they should do it. I am not
    afraid of men or devils. I have none of those fears, jealousies,
    dreads, forebodings, surmisings, &c. I put my trust in God, and
    whatever God does for me is only for my salvation.

    A man is a bad teamster who runs his team in the worst road. What
    I have already said is only to prepare the way. [Here five of the
    Pottawattomie tribe appeared with their interpreter, and were
    assisted to the stand by the President.] I am going to tell of
    something that surprised me at the beginning of the Church. I have
    handled, heard, seen and known things which I have not yet told.

    After the Church began to grow, it was favored with marvelously
    wise men. They had so much wisdom that they could dispute what God
    said, and what His servant said. They were opposed to virtue. They
    would say they had revelations and visions, and were as certain
    that the Lord had given it as I was that the devil had.

    He referred to the children of Israel who were snivelling and
    murmuring about their leeks and onions, &c., &c.; and so it is in
    these last days; some men are always yelling about what the Church
    believes and opposing every good thing.

    I want devils to gratify themselves; and if howling, yelling and
    yelping will do you any good, do it till you are all damned.

    If calling us devils, &c., will do you any good, let us have the
    whole of it, and you can then go on your way to hell without a
    grunt.

    We hear these things ever since the Church existed. They have come
    up with us; they have had so much more wisdom, they knew all about
    the kingdom before God revealed it, and they know all things before
    they were heard; they understand more than God knows. We gather of
    all kinds. If we get all nations, we get all wisdom, cunning, and
    everything else.

    The sectarians cannot be as wise as we are, for they have only got
    {292} man's plans, the devil's plans, and, the best of all, we have
    God's plan.

    I do not know whether there are any of these wise men here this
    morning or not; I have merely given this as a part of the history
    of this Church. I am disposed to give some reasons why salvation
    only belongs to the kingdom of God, and to that alone.

    I will endeavor to show why salvation belongs to us more
    peculiarly, in contradistinction to all other bodies. Will this be
    clear enough?

    I discover one thing: Mankind have labored under one universal
    mistake about this--viz., salvation was distinct from government;
    _i. e_., that I can build a Church without government, and that
    thing have power to save me!

    When God sets up a system of salvation He sets up a system of
    government. When I speak of a government, I mean what I say. I mean
    a government that shall rule over temporal and spiritual affairs.

    Every man is a government of himself, and infringes upon no
    government. A man is not an honorable man, if he is not above all
    law and above government.

    I see in our town we have need of government. Some study law only
    for the purpose of seeing how many feuds, how many broils they can
    kick up, how much they can disturb the peace of the public without
    breaking the law, and then say--"I know my rights, and will have
    them;" "I did not know it was the marshal, or I would not have done
    it."

    He is no gentleman. Gentlemen would not insult a poor man in the
    street, but would bow to him, as much as those who appear more
    respectable. No marshal or any one else, should pull me up. We
    ought to live a great way within the circle of the laws of the land
    would live far above all law.

    The law of God is far more righteous than the laws of the land. The
    kingdom of God does not interfere with the laws of the land, but
    keeps itself by its own laws. (Reported by Elder Thomas Bullock.)

    Elder Rigdon stopped to refresh himself. The choir sang hymn 104.

    Elder John Taylor, being called upon to address the congregation,
    said--It gives me pleasure to meet and associate with so large
    an assemblage of the Saints. I always feel at home among the
    brethren. I consider them the honorable of the earth; and if I can
    do anything to conduce to their happiness, or that will in anywise
    tend to their edification, I am satisfied.

    I therefore address this congregation with cheerfulness and
    pleasure, and if by unfolding any of the principles of truth that I
    am in possession {293} of, or laying before you anything pertaining
    to the kingdom--if my ideas will enlarge your minds, or produce
    beneficial results to any, I shall consider myself on this, as on
    all other occasions, amply repaid.

    Many things have been spoken by Elder Rigdon concerning the early
    history of this Church. There is no person who has searched the
    oracles of eternal truth, but his mind will be touched with the
    remarks made by our venerable friend, which unfold the dispensation
    of Jehovah, and have a tendency to produce the most thrilling
    feelings in the bosoms of many who are this day present, and
    to promote our general edification. He traces with pleasure on
    the historic page--the rise of nations, kingdoms and empires.
    Historians dwell with great minuteness on the heroic deeds, the
    chivalrous acts, the dangers and deliverances, the tact, bravery,
    and heroism of their chieftains, generals and governments.

    We, as Republicans, look back to the time when this nation was
    under the iron rule of Great Britain, and groaned under the power,
    tyranny and oppression of that powerful nation. We trace with
    delight the name of a Washington, a Jefferson, a LaFayette, and an
    Adams, in whose bosoms burned the spark of liberty. These themes
    are dwelt upon with delight by our legislators, our governors and
    presidents; they are subjects which fire our souls with patriotic
    ardor.

    But if these things animate them so much, how much more great,
    noble and exalted are the things laid before us! They were engaged
    in founding kingdoms and empires that were destined to dissolution
    and decay; and although many of them were great, formidable and
    powerful, they now exist only in name. Their cloud-capped towers,
    their solemn temples, are dissolved, and nothing now remains of
    their former magnificence or ancient grandeur but a few dilapidated
    buildings and broken columns. A few shattered fragments remain to
    tell to this and to other generations the perishable nature of
    earthly pomp and worldly glory.

    They were engaged in founding empires and establishing kingdoms
    and powers that had in themselves the seeds of destruction, and
    were destined to decay. We are laying the foundation of a kingdom
    that shall last forever--that shall bloom in time and blossom in
    eternity. We are engaged in a greater work than ever occupied the
    attention of mortals. We live in a day that prophets and kings
    desired to see, but died without the sight.

    When we hear the history of the rise of this kingdom from one who
    has been with it from its infancy--from the lips of our venerable
    friend who has taken an active part in all the history of the
    Church, can we {294} be surprised if he should feel animated, and
    that his soul should burn with heavenly zeal? We see in him a man
    of God who can contemplate the glories of heaven, the visions of
    eternity, and yet who looks forward to the opening glories which
    the great Elohim has manifested to him pertaining to righteousness
    and peace--a man who now beholds the things roll on which he has
    long since beheld in prophetic vision.

    Most men have established themselves in authority by laying
    desolate other kingdoms and the destruction of other powers. Their
    kingdoms have been founded in blood, and supported in tyranny and
    oppression. The greatest chieftains of the earth have obtained
    their glory--if glory it can be called--by blood, carnage and ruin.
    One nation has been built up at the expense and ruin of another,
    and one man has been made at the expense of another; and yet these
    great men were called honorable for their inglorious deeds of
    rapine. They have slain their thousands, and caused the orphans to
    weep and the widows to mourn.

    Men did these things because they could do it--because they had
    power to desolate nations, and spread terror and desolation.
    They have made themselves immortal as great men. The patriots of
    this country had indeed a laudable object in view--a plausible
    excuse for the course they took. They stood in defense of their
    rights, liberty and freedom. But where are now those principles
    of freedom? Where are the laws that protect all men in their
    religious opinions? Where the laws that say, "A man shall worship
    God according to the dictates of his own conscience?" What say ye,
    ye Saints--ye who are exiles in the land of liberty? How came you
    here? Can you in this land of equal right return in safety to your
    possessions in Missouri? No. You are exiles from thence, and there
    is no power, no voice, no arm to redress your grievance. Is this
    the gracious boon for which your fathers fought and struggled and
    died? Shades of the venerable dead, could you but gaze upon this
    scene, and witness tens of thousands of Americans in exile on
    Columbia's soil--if pity could touch your bosoms, how you would
    mourn for the oppressed! If indignation, how would you curse the
    heartless wretches that have so desecrated and polluted the temple
    of liberty? "How has the gold become dim, and the fine gold, how
    has it changed." Let it not be told among the monarchs of Europe,
    lest they laugh and say, "Ha; so would we have it."

    Ye Saints, never let it go abroad that ye are exiles in the land of
    liberty, lest ye disgrace your republic in the eyes of the nations
    of the earth; but tell it to those who robbed and plundered and
    refused to give you your rights. Tell your rulers that all their
    deeds of fame are tarnished, and their glory is departed.

    {295} Are we now, indeed, in a land of liberty, of freedom, of
    equal rights? Would to God I could answer, Yes. But no, no, I
    cannot! They have robbed us, we are stripped of our possessions,
    many of our friends are slain, and our government says, "Your cause
    is just, but we can do nothing for you."

    Hear it, ye great men, we are here in exile! Here are thousands of
    men in bondage in a land of liberty--of freedom! If ye have any
    patriotism, shake off your fetters and come and proclaim us free,
    and give us our rights. I speak of this government as being one of
    the best or governments--as one of the greatest and purest; and
    yet, what a melancholy picture! O ye venerable fathers who fought
    for your liberty, blush for your children, and mourn, mourn over
    your country's shame! We are now talking about a government which
    sets herself up as a pattern for the nations of the earth, and yet,
    oh, what a picture! If this is the best, the most patriotic, the
    most free, what is the situation of the rest?

    Here we speak with national pride of a Washington, a LaFayette, a
    Monroe and a Jefferson, who fought for their liberties, achieved
    one of the greatest victories ever won; and scarcely has one
    generation passed away before fifteen thousand citizens petition
    government for redress of their wrongs, and they turn a deaf ear to
    their cry.

    Let us compare this with the Church of Christ. Fourteen years
    ago a few men assembled in a log cabin; they saw the visions of
    heaven, and gazed upon the eternal world; they looked through the
    rent vista of futurity, and beheld the glories of eternity; they
    were planting those principles which were concocted in the bosom
    of Jehovah; they were laying a foundation for the salvation of the
    world, and those principles which they then planted have not yet
    begun to dwindle; but the fire still burns in their bones; the
    principles are planted in different nations and are wafted on every
    breeze.

    When I gaze upon this company of men, I see those who are actuated
    by patriotic and noble principles, who will stand up in defense
    of the oppressed, of whatever country, nation, color or clime. I
    see it in their countenances. It is planted by the Spirit of God.
    They have received it from the great Elohim, and all the power or
    influence of mobs, priestcraft or corrupt men cannot quench it.
    It will burn. It is comprehensive as the designs of God, and as
    expansive as the universe and reaches to all the world. No matter
    whether it was an Indian, a negro, or any other man or set of men
    that are oppressed, you would stand forth in their defense.

    I say unto you, continue to cherish those principles. Let them
    expand. And if the tree of liberty has been blasted in this
    nation--if it has been gnawed by worms, and already blight has
    overspread it, we {296} will stand up in defense of our liberties,
    and proclaim ourselves free in time and in eternity.

    The choir, by request, sang, "O stop and tell me, Red Man." After
    prayer by Elder John P. Greene, the meeting was adjourned for one
    hour.

coast west from Oregon to Texas.

CHAPTER XIII.

CONFERENCE OF THE CHURCH, APRIL, 1844, CONTINUED--ADDRESS OF PATRIARCH
HYRUM SMITH--THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE.

_Saturday, April 6, 1844, [Conference Report Continued_.]

    The President arrived at the stand at half-past two o'clock, p.m.
    The choir sang a hymn; after which prayer by Elder John P. Greene,
    when the choir sang another hymn.

    Elder Rigdon resumed his history of the Church.

    A little before five o'clock the assembly was dismissed without
    ceremony, until next morning, on the appearance of a shower. The
    people had scarcely time to retire before a heavy shower of rain,
    wind, thunder and lightning followed. A splendid double rainbow
    seen in the heavens.

    _Sunday, 7_.--

    Very pleasant morning. The President arrived at ten o'clock, the
    largest congregation ever seen in Nauvoo having assembled. The
    choir sang the hymn, "Ye slumbering nations that have slept."

    President Rigdon offered an affectionate appeal for the prayers of
    the Saints on behalf of the sick, and then prayer by Elder George
    J. Adams.

    Choir sang the hymn, "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning," &c.

    _President Joseph Smith_.

    The Mayor requested the people to keep good order, and observed
    to the police, who were round the outskirts of the congregation
    to keep order, "Policemen, I want you to exercise your authority;
    and don't say you can't do anything for us, for the constitutional
    power calls you to keep good order, and God Almighty calls you, and
    we command you to do it."

    Elder Sidney Rigdon arose and continued his subject of yesterday.

    Choir sang. Benediction. Intermission.

    During the intermission, thirty-five were baptized in the
    Mississippi river for the remission of their sins.

    _Address of Elder Hyrum Smith, Patriarch to the Church_.

    _At 2 o'clock p. m._

    Patriarch Hyrum Smith arrived at the stand, and said he wanted to
    say something about the temple.

    "We want 200,000 shingles, as we shall resume the work on the
    Temple immediately. All who have not paid their tithing, come
    on and do it. We want provisions, money, boards, planks, and
    anything that is good; we don't want any more old guns or watches.
    I thought some time ago I would get up a small subscription,
    so that the sisters might do something. In consequence of some
    misunderstanding, it has not gone on as at first. It is a matter of
    my own; I do not ask it as a tithing. I give a privilege to any one
    to pay a cent a week, or fifty cents a year. I want it by next fall
    to buy nails and glass. It is difficult to get money. I know that a
    small subscription will bring more than a large one. The poor can
    help in this way. I take the responsibility upon myself, and call
    again upon the sisters. I call again until I get about $1,000. It
    only requires two thousand subscribers.

    I have sent this subscription plan to England and the branches. I
    am not to be dictated to by any one except the Prophet and God. I
    want you to pay in your subscriptions to me, and it shall always be
    said boldly by me, the sisters bought the glass in that house, and
    their names shall be written in the Book of the Law of the Lord. It
    is not a tax, but a free will offering to procure something which
    shall ever be a monument of your works. No member of the Relief
    Society got it up. I am the man that did it. They ought not to
    infringe upon it. I am not a member of the Female Relief Society! I
    am one of the committee of the Lord's House.

    I wish to accomplish something, I wish all the Saints to have an
    opportunity to do something. I want the poor with the purse of five
    dollars to have a chance. The widow's two mites were more in the
    eyes of the Lord than the purse of the rich; and the poor woman
    shall have a seat in the house of God--she who pays her two mites
    as well as the rich, because it is all she has. I wish to have a
    place in that house. I intend to stimulate the brethren. I want to
    get the roof on this season. I want to get the windows in, in the
    winter, so that we may be able to dedicate the House of the Lord
    by this time next year, if nothing more than one room. I will call
    upon the brethren to do something.

    I cannot make a comparison between the House of God and anything
    now in existence. Great things are to grow out of that house.
    There {299} is a great and mighty power to grow out of it. There
    is an endowment. Knowledge is power. We want knowledge. We have
    frequently difficulties with persons who profess to be Latter-day
    Saints. When the sacrament will be administered in the Lord's House
    it will do away with a great deal of difficulty that is now in
    existence. If we can have a privilege and confess our faults unto
    God and one another every Sabbath day, it will do away with these.
    * * * You sisters shall have a seat in that house. I will stand on
    the top of that pulpit and proclaim to all what the sisters have
    done. When you offer up your sacraments every Sabbath, you will
    feel well a whole week; you will get a great portion of the Spirit
    of God, enough to last you a week--and you will increase. We are
    now deprived of the privilege of giving the necessary instruction;
    hence we want a house.

    All the money shall be laid out for what you design it. It shall
    not be paid for anything else. I am one of the committee. The
    committee tells me the quarry is blockaded; it is filled with rock.
    The stone cutters are wanting work. Come on with your teams as soon
    as conference is over. It is not necessary for me to tell who will
    come and do it. I will prophesy that you will do it. There is not
    one in the city but what will do right if he knows it, with only
    one or two exceptions, and they are not worth notice. God will
    take care of them, and if He doesn't, the devil will. I described
    them once, and you will always know them while you see them. They
    will keep hopping till they hop out of town. Some of them are tree
    toads, who climb the trees and are continually croaking.

    We are now the most noble people on the face of the globe, and
    we have no occasion to fear tadpoles. We are designated by the
    All-seeing Eye to do good, not to stoop to anything low. We are apt
    to suffer prejudice to get into our hearts on hearing reports. We
    never should allow it--never should pass our judgment until we hear
    both sides.

    I will tell a Dutch anecdote: A certain Dutchman had a case brought
    before him, and heard one side, and he gave in his decision--"Sure
    you have got the case;" and when the other party brought their
    witnesses, he said again, "Sure, you have got the case, too." If
    you hear of any one in high authority, that he is rather inclined
    to apostasy, don't let prejudice arise, but pray for him. God may
    feel after him, and he may return. Never speak reproachfully nor
    disrespectfully; he is in the hands of God. I am one of those
    peacemakers who take a stand above these little things. It has
    been intimated we should have investigations this conference. Do
    you think I would trouble this conference with it? If I have a
    difficulty with a man, I will go and settle it. Let them settle
    their difficulties. There is not a man who has had a difficulty
    {300} who would trouble this congregation about it. We ask no
    favors; we can settle it ourselves. Don't think anything about
    persons who are on the eve of apostasy; God is able to take care of
    them. Let God judge, do your duty and let men alone.

    Never undertake to destroy men because they do some evil thing. It
    is natural for a man to be led, and not driven. Put down iniquity
    by good works. Many men speak without any contemplation; if they
    had given the matter a little contemplation it would not have been
    spoken. We ought to be careful what we say, and take the example of
    Jesus, cast over men the mantle of charity, and try to cover their
    faults. We are made to enlighten, and not to darken one another;
    save men, not destroy them. Do unto others what you would have them
    do unto you. It is well enough to root out conspiracy. Do not fear,
    but if you are in the right track, having God to guide you, He will
    save you; for God will save you, if He has to destroy the wicked so
    as by fire.

    I want to put down all false influence. If I thought I should be
    saved and any in the congregation be lost, I should not be happy.
    For this purpose Jesus effected a resurrection. Our Savior is
    competent to save all from death and hell. I can prove it out of
    the revelation. I would not serve a God that had not all wisdom and
    all power.

    The reason why I feel so good is because I have a big soul. There
    are men with small bodies who have got souls like Enoch. We have.
    We have gathered our big souls from the ends of the earth. The
    Gospel picks the big souls out of all creation, and we will get the
    big souls out of all the nations, and we shall have the largest
    city in the world.

    We will gather all the big souls out of every nation. As soon as
    the Gospel catches hold of noble souls, it brings them all right
    up to Zion. There is a thing called guiding star. The Gospel is
    similar. We will have a people great enough to be saved.

    Popery could not write what Enoch preached. He told the people that
    the Spirit of God took him up into a high mountain, showed him the
    distress of the people--the destruction of the world, and he said
    his heart swelled wide as eternity. But adherents of Popery could
    not receive anything as large as that, and every man-made society
    is just like them. Men's souls conform to the society in which they
    live, with very few exceptions, and when men come to live with the
    Mormons, their souls swell as if they were going to stride the
    planets as I stride the Republic of America. I can believe that man
    can go from planet to planet--a man gets so high in the mansions
    above.

    A certain good sister came to my house and she was troubled because
    she heard so many big things. She thought it weakened her faith.
    I {301} told her she had too much faith. She believed too much. I
    will tell you how you may know whether the thing is true or not.
    When any one comes to you with a lie, you feel troubled. God will
    trouble you, and will not approbate you in such belief. You had
    better get some antidote to get rid of it. Humble yourself before
    God, and ask Him for His Spirit and pray to Him to judge it for
    you. It is better not to have so much faith, than to have so much
    as to believe all the lies.

    Before this conference closes, I want to get all the Elders
    together.

    I shall make a proclamation. I want to take the line and ax and
    hew you, and make you as straight as possible. I will make you
    straight as a stretched line. Every Elder that goes from Nauvoo to
    preach the Gospel, if he preaches anything else, we will silence
    him through the public print. I want all the Elders to meet and to
    understand; and if they preach anything but the pure truth, we will
    call them home.

    At a quarter-past three p.m., President Smith having arrived, the
    choir sang a hymn. Elder Amasa Lyman offered prayer.

    President Joseph Smith delivered a discourse before twenty thousand
    Saints, being the funeral sermon of Elder King Follett.

CHAPTER XIV.

GENERAL CONFERENCE FOR APRIL, 1844, CONCLUDED--THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT
THE WHOLE LAND OF AMERICA IS ZION--INSTRUCTIONS TO ELDERS SET APART FOR
MISSIONS--A GENERAL CONFERENCE IN ENGLAND.

_Monday, April 8, 1844.--[Conference Report Continued_.]

    At three-quarters past 9 a.m., President Joseph Smith took his seat
    on the stand and requested the choir to sing a hymn. He called upon
    Elder Brigham Young to read 1st Corinthians, 15th chapter, as his
    own lungs were injured.

    Elder Brigham Young said--to continue the subject of President
    Smith's discourse yesterday, I shall commence by reading the 15th
    chapter of 1st Corinthians, from an old Bible; and requested W. W.
    Phelps to read it.

    Prayer by Elder Brigham Young, after which the choir sang a hymn.

    _President Joseph Smith's Remarks--The Whole of America Zion_.

    President Joseph Smith said:--It is just as impossible, for me to
    continue the subject of yesterday as to raise the dead. My lungs
    are worn out. There is a time to all things, and I must wait. I
    will give it up, and leave the time to those who can make you hear,
    and I will continue the subject of my discourse some other time. I
    want to make a proclamation to the Elders. I wanted you to stay,
    in order that I might make this proclamation. You know very well
    that the Lord has led this Church by revelation. I have another
    revelation in relation to economy in the Church--a great, grand,
    and glorious revelation. I shall not be able to dwell as largely
    upon it now as at some other time; but I will give you the first
    principles. You know there has been great discussion in relation
    to Zion--where it is, and where the gathering of the dispensation
    is, and which I am now going to tell you. The prophets have spoken
    and written upon it; but I will make a proclamation that will cover
    a broader ground._ The whole of America is Zion itself {319} from
    north to south, and is described by the Prophets, who declare that
    it is the Zion where the mountain of the Lord should be, and that
    it should be in the center of the land._ When Elders shall take up
    and examine the old prophecies in the Bible, they will see it.

    The declaration this morning is, that as soon as the Temple and
    baptismal font are prepared, we calculate to give the Elders of
    Israel their washings and anointings, and attend to those last
    and more impressive ordinances, without which we cannot obtain
    celestial thrones. But there must be a holy place prepared for
    that purpose. There was a proclamation made during the time that
    the foundation of the Temple was laid to that effect, and there
    are provisions made until the work is completed, so that men may
    receive their endowments and be made kings and priests unto the
    Most High God, having nothing to do with temporal things, but their
    whole time will be taken up with things pertaining to the house
    of God. There must, however, be a place built expressly for that
    purpose, and for men to be baptized for their dead. It must be
    built in this the central place; for every man who wishes to save
    his father, mother, brothers, sisters and friends, must go through
    all the ordinances for each one of them separately, the same as for
    himself, from baptism to ordination, washings and anointings, and
    receive all the keys and powers of the Priesthood, the same as for
    himself.

    _I have received instructions from the Lord that from henceforth
    wherever the Elders of Israel shall build up churches and branches
    unto the Lord throughout the States, there shall be a stake of
    Zion. In the great cities, as Boston, New York, &c., there shall
    be stakes._ It is a glorious proclamation, and I reserved it to
    the last, and designed it to be understood that this work shall
    commence after the washings, anointings and endowments have been
    performed here.

    The Lord has an established law in relation to the matter: there
    must be a particular spot for the salvation of our dead. I verily
    believe there will be a place, and hence men who want to save
    their dead can come and bring their families, do their work by
    being baptized and attending to the other ordinances for their
    dead, and then may go back again to live and wait till they go
    to receive their reward. I shall leave my brethren to enlarge on
    this subject: it is my duty to teach the doctrine. I would teach
    it more fully--the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. God is
    not willing to let me gratify you; but I must teach the Elders, and
    they should teach you. God made Aaron to be the mouth piece for the
    children of Israel, [1] and He will make me be god to you in {320}
    His stead, and the Elders to be mouth for me; and if you don't like
    it, you must lump it. I have been giving Elder Adams instruction in
    some principles to speak to you, and if he makes a mistake, I will
    get up and correct him.

    Elder G. J. Adams preached a discourse which occupied three hours,
    and which could be heard a great distance.

    President Joseph Smith turned over the conference into the hands of
    the Twelve.

    Choir sang a hymn. Prayer.

    President Hyrum Smith called the conference to order at twenty-five
    minutes to four p.m., and spoke to the assembly one hour and a half.

    He treated upon the subject of Elders preaching abroad. He said
    it was a matter of consequence that the Elders of Israel should
    know what they were about when they go to preach the Gospel. They
    should, like Paul, be ready to give a reason for the hope of their
    calling. When they are sent to preach the Gospel, they should
    preach the Gospel and nothing else, if they wish to stand approved
    themselves. The Elders are sent into the world to preach faith,
    repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, and the laying on of
    hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost and they should let the
    mysteries alone.

    God has commanded you to preach repentance to this generation; and
    if this generation will not receive the first principles of the
    Gospel and the Book of Mormon, they will receive nothing greater.
    Just go and do as you are told and God will bless you.

    It is the power of God that is going to convert the world, and
    nothing but the power of God. Every man who knows me knows that I
    have taught these principles from the beginning. It is the honest
    and pure in heart that will harken to the everlasting covenant.
    They are those who are noble and good; they will feed and clothe
    you and receive your testimony; and we want the Elders to gather
    out the good seed to Nauvoo. The day will come when you will see
    the wicked flee when no man pursueth. I want you to be wise as
    serpents and harmless as doves. Preach principles that will stand
    the test of ages; teach them good precepts and save souls, go forth
    as men of God, and you will find friends wherever you go. Drink
    deep of the Spirit of Truth and a great and mighty work shall be
    wrought in the world; hundreds {321} and tens of thousands shall
    flock to the standard and go up to Zion.

    Many other remarks were made by the speaker.

    After which Sidney Rigdon made a few remarks, and concurred in what
    Brother Hyrum had said.

    Twelve minutes to six, adjourned to April 9th, at eight o'clock,
    a.m.

    _Special Meeting of Elders_.

    _Tuesday, 9.--[Conference Report Continued]._ At 8 a.m., the Elders
    assembled at the stand, (President Brigham Young presiding,) and
    were addressed by Elder Amasa Lyman; after which: President Brigham
    Young said--

    _Address of Brigham Young_.

    What has been given is correct; the speech and conduct of Elders
    one towards another is frequently wrong; one Elder will speak evil
    of another; and while you trample others you will sink yourself.
    A man has sinking principles; but if his feelings are elevated,
    he will build up others and build up himself. Just as sure as one
    Elder tries to build himself upon the destruction of another, he
    will surely sink himself.

    I would like to sit and hear the brethren teach for a week; but as
    business is pressing, we must hurry through. Preach repentance to
    this generation. Faith must go before repentance, and of course all
    men must follow the course and obey the laws and ordinances for the
    remission of sins, so as to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and
    then your mission is done. Let a man who goes into the vineyard
    build up all he can. If a man preaches anything in error, pray to
    God that no man may remember it any more. No Elder will correct
    another in public before unbelievers unless he has the sinking
    principle. I call all the Elders together to witness that I always
    use charity, for it covers a multitude of sins.

    _North and South America Zion_.

    Let us obey the proclamation of Joseph Smith concerning the Elders
    going forth into the vineyard to build up the Temple, get their
    endowments, and be prepared to go forth and preach the Gospel. You
    may build up Zion, and learn to be men, and not children. It was a
    perfect sweepstakes when the Prophet called North and South America
    Zion. Let us go to and build the Temple with all our might, that we
    may build up the kingdom when established and her cords lengthened.
    It is a perfect knock-down to the devil's kingdom. There is not
    a faithful Elder who cannot, if he is humble and diligent, build
    up the Church. There are many men who will give you large sums to
    build a {322} Stake of Zion where they live. It proves the words of
    the Prophet of the last days.

    The Priesthood is fitted to every capacity in the world. There are
    blessings and conditions in that Priesthood that suit every man.
    This will suit the condition of thousands, because it is as broad
    as the heavens, deep as hell, and wide as eternity.

    I am asked all sorts of questions about making gods and devils, and
    organizing the eternal worlds; but we could not get it precisely
    into our understandings so as to make them. The God we serve is
    the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. There is no need of breaking
    the law of the land if you keep the law of the Lord. I want a wife
    that can take care of my children when I am away, who can pray,
    lay on hands, anoint with oil, and baffle the enemy; and this is a
    spiritual wife.

    The sweepstakes is a perfect knock-down to the devil. We will
    build up churches and establish Zion and her stakes. This is a
    fire which, cannot be put out: it has spread far faster than ever
    it did before. If you kick us and cuff us, we will turn the world
    upside down, and make the cart draw the horse. We want to build the
    Temple and have the roof on this fall, in the name of Israel's God.
    There are hundreds of Elders who will sell their property to build
    up the Temple. Let us pay up our tithing. If there are any men who
    have not paid their tithing, they will not get in there. Let the
    branches send teams with provisions to work all the year.

    We are acquainted with the views of Gen. Smith, the Democrats and
    Whigs and all factions. It is now time to have a President of
    the United States. Elders will be sent to preach the Gospel and
    electioneer. The government belongs to God. No man can draw the
    dividing line between the government of God and the government of
    the children of men. You can't touch the Gospel without infringing
    upon the common avocations of men. They may have helps and
    governments in the Church, but it is all one at last.

    _Address of Hyrum Smith the Patriarch_.

    Patriarch Hyrum Smith said: I never knew a proclamation to be
    understood at once. President Brigham Young wished to draw the
    attention of the brethren, first to build the Temple and get your
    washings, anointings, and endowments; after that to build up
    branches throughout the nations. We must do all we can to build up
    the Temple, and after that to build churches. The gathering will
    continue here until the Temple is so far finished that the Elders
    can get their endowments; and after that the gathering will be from
    the nations to North and South America, which is the land of Zion.
    North and South America, are the symbols of the wings. The {323}
    gathering from the old countries will always be to headquarters,
    and I have no doubt this conference will do a great deal of good.

    We have every power and principle to teach the people. Say what
    God says, and say no more. Never deviate one fraction from what
    God tells you. Elder Rigdon's remarks were very correct. Give
    out the simple principles. A man never fails who only says what
    he knows; and if any man says more, and can't give reasons, he
    falls short. Preach the first principles of the Gospel--preach
    them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and
    additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You can
    enlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then
    be able to make them more plainly understood by those who teach,
    so that you will meet with scarcely any honest man but will obey
    them, and none who can oppose. Adduce sufficient reason to prove
    all things, and you can convert every honest man in the world. The
    knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is not prevalent in the
    world, although it is written in the Holy Book. You can prove it
    by the Holy Book they profess to believe in, and your arguments
    will be so strong and convincing, that people will hear and obey
    it by thousands. The Savior says that to you it is given to know
    the mysteries of God, but to the world it is not given. You have
    power; you are authorized to put down every foolish thing you hear.
    A wise man will put it out of existence as he goes along; for light
    cleaveth unto light, knowledge to knowledge, and intelligence to
    intelligence.

    We engage in the election the same as in any other principle: you
    are to vote for good men, and if you do not do this it is a sin: to
    vote for wicked men, it would be sin. Choose the good and refuse
    the evil. Men of false principles have preyed upon us like wolves
    upon helpless lambs. Damn the rod of tyranny; curse it. Let every
    man use his liberties according to the Constitution. Don't fear man
    or devil; electioneer with all people, male and female, and exhort
    them to do the thing that is right. We want a President of the U.
    S., not a party President, but a President of the whole people;
    for a party President disfranchises the opposite party. Have a
    President who will maintain every man in his rights.

    I wish all of you to do all the good you can. We will try and
    convert the nations into one solid union. I despise the principle
    that divides the nation into party and faction. I want it to grow
    up like a green bay tree. Damn the system of splitting up the
    nation into opposite belligerent parties. Whatever are the rights
    of men guaranteed by the Constitution of these United States, let
    them have them. Then, if we were all in union, no one dare attempt
    to put a warlike foot on our soil. I don't like to see the rights
    of Americans trampled down. I am opposed to the policy of all such
    persons as would allow Great Britain {324} or any other power to
    take from us Oregon or any portion of our national territory; and
    damn all who attempt it. Lift up your voices like thunder: there is
    power and influence enough among us to put in a President. I don't
    wonder at the old Carthaginian lawyer being afraid of Joseph Smith
    being elected.

    Smith to be the candidate for the next President.]

    Elder Heber C. Kimball arose and said--What Brother Hyrum has told
    you is God's truth, and will eventually come to pass. As he was
    making his observations to the Elders, it made me think of the
    first time that I went out into the vineyard to preach. I dwelt on
    one subject till it branched like unto a tree that was cultivated,
    until the branches shot forth in all directions. Suppose you
    had only one seed to plant, and that seed was an acorn, and you
    spend your time in cultivating it till it comes forth a great and
    mighty tree, branching forth with many branches, and bearing fruit
    abundantly after its own kind. So it is with the first principles
    of the Gospel, they branch out in all directions, unfolding new
    light continually. They are eternal principles. I never preached
    anything else but the first principles. When first we went to
    England, we preached nothing else, and never even touched on the
    gathering, as there was no place of gathering, the Church having
    been driven from Jackson County and also from Kirtland, and the
    Prophets, Patriarchs, Apostles and Saints were wandering in the
    wilderness seeking for a home; but as soon as the people were
    baptized and received the Holy Ghost, the most of them had the
    spirit of prophecy, and prophesied of coming to this land, as being
    the land of Zion; and the time would come that they should come
    here. Yet we never taught the doctrine of the gathering or Book of
    Doctrine and Covenants.

    If you tell the people to stay, they will gather here stronger
    than ever. If you want to cut anything off, you should know how
    to restore. You should never cut off the ears of the people until
    you are able to make them others. It is no matter what way you
    convert them so you do convert them to believe the doctrines of
    the very Bible they have always professed to believe. It is no
    use attempting to teach them other things until you can make them
    believe the principles contained in the Bible which they have been
    taught to reverence and believe from their infancy. It teaches the
    gathering and all the principles of the Gospel necessary to be
    taught to the unbelieving world. This is the thrashing floor, where
    the wheat is gathered to be thrashed. There are a great many green
    heads, and they of course have to be pelted a little harder. After
    the {325} wheat is thrashed, it has to go through the fanning-mill,
    and then the screen, and then the smut-mill; then it has to be
    ground and to be bolted: but many bolt away and leave. If you get a
    cudgeling, don't be mad, for your heads are green. We are going to
    arrange a plan for Conferences, and we design to send Elders to all
    the different States to get up meetings and protracted meetings,
    and electioneer for Joseph to be the next President.

    A great many of the Elders will necessarily have to leave their
    families, and the mothers will have to assume the responsibility of
    governing and taking care of the children to a much greater extent
    than when their husbands were at home. I therefore exhort them to
    be humble, faithful, and diligent, seeking to the Lord for wisdom
    to rear up their children in righteousness and prepare them to roll
    on the work of the Lord when their fathers shall have been worn out
    in the ministry. The mothers, therefore, are the persons who will
    more or less have to train the children.

    Twenty minutes to 11: A call was made for the volunteers to go
    preaching to pass out to the green. A great company moved out and
    returned to the right of the stand, and were numbered 244.

    Twenty minutes to 1: Adjourned for one hour.

    Met according to adjournment. The names of the volunteers were
    called, and places assigned to each.

    _Brigham Young's Instruction to the Elders_.

    President Brigham Young said: Take care of yourselves, be wise, be
    humble, and you will prosper. I curse all who degrade themselves
    with corruption and licentiousness, as many have done. Magnify your
    calling, keep yourselves pure and innocent, and your path shall be
    clear as the horizon. We have all manner of prejudices to contend
    with. We thank God for the Gospel, the Book of Mormon, and the
    Temple, and sing glory to God; and yet there are characters among
    us who from mere covetousness will squeeze a sixpence two inches
    long, and we have all their iniquity to bear.

    We have the honor to be the first fruits of this dispensation,
    and have to contend with floods of oppression. Go humbly and
    prayerfully, trusting and believing in God, and what you desire to
    do you will accomplish. Cease not to ask the Father what you shall
    do, and He will give you the Spirit. You know not the day of your
    visitation. What is asked for in the name of Jesus Christ will be
    granted. J. C. Bennett's power fell like the lightning. God was
    asked not to let Joe Duncan be governor, and it was so. We asked
    the Lord to deliver us from Governor Reynolds, of Missouri; and he
    shot himself, and has {326} gone to hell. As for Squire Warren, of
    Quincy, it takes two of him to make a shadow.

    The Lord is cutting off the bitterest branches. Look at the
    explosion of the big gun on board of the _Princeton_ war-steamer
    at Washington. God will deliver His faithful Saints. You will
    be innocent, and do a good work: you will come back, and bring
    your sheaves with you, rejoicing. Every man has the privilege of
    practicing godliness and virtue, and of manifesting himself as
    a servant of the Most High God. Doctor Foster lost his money by
    gambling, and joined blacklegs. Those men who say there is evil in
    the Church are evil themselves. This doctrine is the best for any
    man to practice, and will do him good. Ask of God that you may have
    wisdom to do all things. If you hear anything of an Elder preaching
    false doctrine, ask of God in full faith that it may be taken off
    the minds of the people.

    A contribution was taken up for President Joseph Smith, $100 was
    raised, and another $100 loaned.

[Sidenote: Comment of President Smith on the Conference.]

_Tuesday, April 9th, [Continued]:--_The weather has been beautiful
for the conference; and they have been the greatest, best, and most
glorious five consecutive days ever enjoyed by this generation. Much
good was done. Many spectators were present from Quincy, Alton, Warsaw,
Fort Madison, and other towns. When we consider the immense number
present, and the good order that was preserved, it speaks much in favor
of the morality of the city.

In the afternoon I rode out with Emma, Dr. Goforth, and others to the
mound. The peach trees look beautiful.

The Mayor and Marshal received a notification to produce docket and
other papers in case of O. F. Bostwick, before the circuit court at
Carthage; also a similar notification to produce papers in case of Amos
Davis, appealed before Circuit Court.

    The number of members and authorities of each conference being
    ascertained as nearly as possible, it was determined that the
    delegates should represent the condition of each conference, and
    what alterations or measures were necessary to be adopted for the
    well being of each other.

    Elder Charles Miller having remarked that he had been challenged to
    discussion, and had accepted it, it led to some remarks from Elder
    Ward as to the very little good effected in general by discussions;
    and that it was beneath the servants of God to turn aside from the
    path of duty to wrangle and dispute like the people of the world;
    and that while the professors of modern religion were in a manner
    devouring each other, the path of the Saints ought to be onward in
    the proclamation of the principles of truth.

    Elder Hedlock agreed with the remarks of Elder Ward, and stated
    that they were in perfect accordance with the advice of the First
    Presidency, and that the evil ought to be guarded against as much
    as possible.

    [The remaining sessions of the conference were devoted to hearing
    reports from the several conferences comprising the mission,
    giving instruction relative to ordaining men to the ministry,
    and the manner of conducting the ministry of the Church to make
    it effective. Among other items of interest was a communication
    from the Twelve in Nauvoo making the nomination of Elders Reuben
    Hedlock and Thomas Ward to preside over the British Mission, which
    nomination was accepted by the conference, and these brethren were
    unanimously {330} sustained as the presidency of the mission. The
    publication of the _Millennial Star_ had been ordered suspended
    by the Twelve, but the conference voted by unanimous acclamation
    that this conference request the quorum of the Twelve to permit
    the continued publication of that periodical. The minutes of the
    conference state that--]

    "Elder Hedlock addressed the assembly on the subject of the
    publications, and was desirous of taking the sense of that meeting
    on the same. It was true that the quorum of the Twelve had advised
    that the publication of the _Millennial Star_ be stopped, and
    had given him authority to publish a circular as occasion might
    require; but he believed most sincerely that the stoppage of the
    _Star_ would have a most injurious tendency.

    "Several having spoken to the same effect, Elder Ward remarked
    that, if a publication was to be issued at all, it appeared
    trifling with the interest of the cause to change the name,
    inasmuch as the office had received the name of the _Millennial
    Star_ Office, and many letters came to them with that address."

    [Then followed the action of the conference upon the subject noted
    above. Permission must have been given soon afterwards to renew the
    publication of the _Star,_ since it missed but one issue, that of
    May, 1844.--it was then published monthly. See vols. v and vi.]

Footnotes:

1. The scripture alluded to in the text is as follows:--Moses pleaded
to be excused from the appointment to deliver Israel on the plea that
he was not eloquent; whereupon the Lord said: "Is not Aaron the Levite
thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh
forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his
heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put in his mouth; * * * And
he shall be the spokesman unto the people: * * * * he shall be to thee
instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God" (Exodus
iv:14-16.)

Somewhat later this passage occurs: "And the Lord said unto Moses, See,
I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy
prophet" (Exodus vii:1.)

_Wednesday, April 10, 1844.--_The Twelve were in council arranging a
plan for appointing conferences.

_Thursday, 11.--_In general council in Masonic Hall, morning and
afternoon. Had a very interesting time. The Spirit of the Lord was with
us, and we closed the council with loud shouts of Hosanna!

_Friday, 12.--_The Twelve met in council. Rode out with Brothers Parker
and Clayton to look at some land.

A conference was held at Cypry, Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Elder
Benjamin L. Clapp, president, and John Brown, clerk. Seven branches
were represented, consisting of 192 members, 12 Elders, 5 Priests, 4
Teachers, and 2 Deacons, all in good standing.

_Saturday, 13.--_At 10 a.m. met in City Council. George P. Styles was
appointed City Attorney. I advise that the council take such a course
as would protect the innocent: that in many cases the attorney would
get his pay off the individual employing him; that the appointment
would be a valuable consideration, and for one year a salary of $100
would be sufficient; perhaps $160 the next year, &c., increasing as
the city increases; and if $100 would not satisfy, we had better have
no attorney. "I would {332} rather give my services as counselor, &c.,
than levy a tax the people are not able to pay; and that every man
ought to be willing to help prop the city by bearing a share of the
burden till the city is able to pay a higher salary. My opinion is
that the officers of the city should be satisfied with a very small
compensation for their services. I have never received twenty-five
dollars for my services; [as counselor] but the peace I have enjoyed in
the rights and liberties of the city has been ample compensation."

I suggested the propriety of inserting a clause in the ordinance to be
made relating to the City Attorney, authorizing him to claim fees of
parties in certain cases, and the small salary satisfy the attorney
in cases where he can get no fees from his client. "I would rather be
docked $100 in my salary than have the $200 given to the City Attorney
by the city."

I also proposed that the Council take into consideration the payment
of the police; also proposed that a public meeting be called in each
ward to see if they will not, then the council will take the case into
consideration.

At 1 p.m., the Municipal Court sat in the assembly room, where I asked
Dr. R. D. Foster if he bore my expenses to Washington, or any part
thereof.

Foster replied he did not.

I stated that Dr. Goforth had said that he was taken in a secret
council when Foster told him he had paid my expenses.

Dr. Foster replied he never had a secret interview with Dr. Goforth,
and gave his version of the meeting.

I then asked him--"Have I ever misused you any way?"

Foster said--"I do not feel at liberty to answer this question, under
existing circumstances?"

I again asked him--"Did I ever misuse you?"

He again replied--"I do not feel at liberty to answer under existing
circumstances."

I then asked--"Did I ever wrong you in deal, or personally misuse you
in any shape?"

{333} Foster said, "I do not feel at liberty to answer. I have treated
you Christianly and friendly too, so far as I have had the ability."

I then asked him to tell me where I had done wrong, and I will ask his
forgiveness; for I want you to prove to this company by your testimony
that I have treated you honorably.

Foster then said--"I shall testify no further at present."

I then asked Justice Aaron Johnson--"Did I ever make oath before you
against Simpson?"

He replied--"Not before the prosecution."

I then told the whole story.

Andrew Colton then came up before the Municipal Court on_ habeas
corpus,_ and was discharged on the insufficiency of the papers.

After which, I preferred the following charge before the High Council
against Dr. Robert D. Foster "for unchristian-like conduct in general,
for abusing my character privily, for throwing out slanderous
insinuations against me, for conspiring against my peace and safety,
for conspiring against my life, for conspiring against the peace of my
family, and for lying."

A charge was preferred against Harrison Sagers for teaching spiritual
wife doctrine and neglecting his family, which was handed over to the
High Council to act upon.

At 2 p.m., Elder John Taylor delivered a political discourse.

About 5 p.m., the _"Maid of Iowa"_ arrived at the Nauvoo House wharf,
filled with passengers from England, led by William Kay. 210 souls
started from Liverpool, and nearly all arrived in good health and
spirits, one smaller company having previously arrived.

_Sunday, 14.--_Rainy day. No meeting at the stand. I preached on board
the _"Maid of Iowa_."

Committee of the Council met in the afternoon at my office.

{334} _Monday, 15.--_At home settling with Dan Jones for steamboat
_"Maid of Iowa."_ She has returned in debt about $1,700. After much
conversation and deliberation, I agreed to buy out Jones, by giving him
property in the city worth $1,231, and assuming the debts.

I rode out in the afternoon.

    Those Elders who are numbered in the foregoing list to preside over
    the different states will appoint conferences in all places in
    their several states where opportunities present, and will attend
    all the conferences, or send experienced and able Elders, who will
    preach the truth in righteousness, and present before the people
    "General Smith's Views of the Powers and Policy of the General
    Government," and seek diligently to get up electors who will go
    for him for the Presidency. All the Elders will be faithful in
    preaching the Gospel in its simplicity and beauty, in all meekness,
    humility, long-suffering and prayerfulness; and the Twelve will
    devote the season to traveling, and will attend as many conferences
    as possible.

    Elder B. Winchester is instructed to pass through Mississippi,
    Alabama, Georgia, North and South Carolina and Virginia, to visit
    the churches, hold conferences, and preside over them.

_Thursday, 18.--_Nine a.m. went into general council until noon and
introduced J. W. Coolidge, D. S. Hollister, and added Lyman Wight's
name.

While at dinner I made mention of the report that Foster, Higbee,_ et
al._ were paying someone's board at my table so as to catch something
against me; so that, if the report is true, they may have something to
carry back.

Two to five thirty p.m. in council.

[Sidenote: Excommunication of the Laws, Fosters, _et. al_.]

At 6 p.m. Brigham Young, Willard Richards, John Taylor, George A.

off Robert D. Foster, Wilson Law, William Law and Jane Law, of Nauvoo,
and Howard Smith of Scott county, Illinois, from the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, for unchristian-like conduct; and their
names were published in the_ Times and Seasons_.

_Friday, 19.--_A company of about eighty Saints arrived.

In the evening rode to the upper steamboat landing.

{342} _Saturday, 20.--_Emma started for St. Louis to purchase goods.

I rode out with Dr. Bernhisel and my boys Frederick and Alexander to
the prairie, which is now very green.

Elders Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff rode to Lima and spent the
night with Father Morley.

_Sunday, 21.--_At home; rainy day. A meeting at the Stand. Elder
Erastus Snow preached on "The Law of Nature."

Elders Young and Woodruff attended a conference and preached to the
Saints in Lima, where twenty-six Elders volunteered to go out preaching.

Elder Kimball attended a conference at Ramus.

_Monday, 22.--_All night lightning, thundering, raining, with strong
east wind which continued through the day.

The river very high; all the mills in the city stopped on account of
the high water.

This morning a man, who had put up at my house told me he wanted to
see me alone. I went into my room with him, when he told me he was a
prophet of God, that he came from Vermont, and he prophesied that this
Government, was about to be overthrown, and the kingdom which Daniel
speaks of was about to be established somewhere in the West, and he
thought in Illinois.

My brother William arrived from New Jersey with some forty or fifty
Saints. I spent some time with him in the evening.

Elders Young and Woodruff started for Nauvoo; but on account of a
tremendous storm of hail and rain, they were glad to take shelter at
Brother William Draper's where they spent the night.

_Tuesday, 9.--_From 9 to 12 a general meeting of citizens friendly to
my election, was held in the hall, to elect a delegate to go to the
Baltimore Convention, to be held on the first Monday in May. D. S.
Hollister was elected.

{343} From 3 to 5 p.m. again assembled, and many speeches were made,
&c.; and appointed the second Monday in May to hold a State Convention
at Nauvoo.

In the evening, visited Agnes, my brother Carlos' widow, and Dr.
Richards, with Hyrum.

_Wednesday, 24.--_Rode up to the steamboat landing, where we found
Elder J. M. Grant, who introduced me to judge William Richards, of New
Jersey, took him to Brother Winchester's.

In the evening Brother Ezra Thayer, Dr. Richards, and Dr. Williams
were in my room, and a man who boarded at the Masonic Hall. At their
request, I gave them a history of the Laws' proceedings, in part, in
trying to make a difficulty in my family, &c.

Gave recommendations to Elders Amasa M. Lyman and D. S. Hollister.

_Thursday, 25.--_Emma returned from St. Louis.

A brother who works in the _St. Louis Gazette_ office came up at the
same time, and wanted to know by what principle I got so much power,
how many inhabitants and armed men we had, &c. I told him I obtained
power on the principles of truth and virtue, which would last when I
was dead and gone, &c.

In general council from 10 till 12, and from 2 to 5, When they
adjourned _sine die_, after appointing a State Convention to meet in
Nauvoo on 17th May. The council then dispersed to go abroad in the
nations.

Instructed Dr. Richards to make out a writ of_ habeas corpus_ for Mr.
Jeremiah Smith, of Iowa, who was expecting to be arrested by the U. S.
Marshal for getting money which was due him, as he says, at Washington.

A play on rational amusement was to commence this evening, but a most
tremendous shower of rain and large hail from the southwest commenced
about six p.m. which prevented it. The small creeks rose over four
feet high, overflowed their banks, sweeping away fences, and doing
considerable damage.

{344} The Mississippi river is higher at this place than ever known by
the oldest inhabitant.

[Sidenote: Violence of the Fosters and Higbees.]

_Friday, 26.--_At home. At 10 a.m. the Marshal went up on the hill to
arrest Augustine Spencer for an assault on his brother, Orson Spencer,
in his own house. Robert D. Foster, Charles Foster and Chauncey L.
Higbee came down. Charles Foster drew a pistol pointed towards me, and
threatened to shoot while standing on the steps of my office. I ordered
him to be arrested and the pistol taken from him, when a struggle
ensued, in which Charles Foster, Robert D. Foster and Chauncey L.
Higbee resisted, and I ordered them to be arrested also, and I as the
Mayor ordered the policemen to be called; then went on to try Augustine
Spencer. He was fined $100, and required to give bonds in $100 to keep
the peace for six months. He appealed the case at once to the Municipal
Court.

Robert D. Foster, Chauncey L. Higbee, and Charles Foster were also
tried for resisting the authorities of the city.

O. P. Rockwell sworn. Marshal John P. Greene sworn:--Said Dr. Foster
swore by God that he would not assist the Marshal, and swore by God
they would see the Mayor in hell before they would go; and that Charles
Foster drew a pistol and presented at the Mayor, which was being
wrested from him when Dr. Robert D. Foster interfered. Charles Foster
and Chauncey L. Higbee said they would be G--d--d if they would not
shoot the Mayor. They breathed out many hard threatenings and menacing
sayings. They said they would consider themselves the favored of God
for the privilege of shooting or ridding the world of such a tyrant
(referring to the Mayor).

Joseph W. Coolidge sworn, and confirmed the Marshal's testimony.

Elbridge Tufts sworn, and confirmed the foregoing statements.

{345} Robert D. Foster, Charles Foster and Chauncey L. Higbee were each
fined $100. They immediately took an appeal to the Municipal Court.

I issued a warrant for Robert D. Foster, on complaint of Willard
Richards, for a breach of ordinance, in that Foster said to Richards;
"You," shaking his fist in the doctor's face, "are another d--ned
black-hearted villain! You tried to seduce my wife on the boat, when
she was going to New York and I can prove it; and the oath is out
against you."

_Saturday, 27.--_A large company of gentlemen from St. Louis and other
places on the river, called at the Mansion. After spending some time,
they returned to the boat, but it was gone, when they again returned to
the Mansion.

At 9 a.m. the case of Dr. Robert D. Foster came up for trial before the
Municipal Court. I had a conversation with Foster in which he charged
me with many crimes, and said that Daniteism was in Nauvoo; and he used
a great variety of vile and false epithets and charges.

The court adjourned to Monday, the 29th at 9 a.m.

Foster agreed to meet me on the second Monday in May, at the Stand,
and have a settlement, and he would publish the result of it in the
Warsaw papers. I told him if he did not agree to be quiet, and not
attempt to raise a mob, I would not meet him; if he would agree to be
quiet, I would be willing to publish the settlement in the _Neighbor_.
But Foster would not agree to be quiet. I then told him I had done my
duty; the skirts of my garments were free from his (Foster's) blood;
I had made the last overtures of peace to him; and then delivered him
into the hands of God, and shook my garments against him as a testimony
thereof.

I continued in the office some time afterwards in conversation, and
then went into the big room and read in the_ Warsaw Signal_ a vile
article against the Saints.

{346} Elder Hiram Smith arrived from Liverpool accompanied by one
hundred and fifty immigrating Saints.

There was a meeting at the Stand at one o'clock, to give instructions
to the Elders going out electioneering. They were addressed by
President Rigdon and William Smith.

Dr. Richards prosecuted Robert D. Foster for slander, &c.

_Sunday, 28.--_At home. A beautiful clear day.

My brother Hyrum preached at the Stand in the morning, and among other
things, said the time will shortly come that when one man makes another
an offender for a word, he shall be cut off from the Church of Jesus
Christ. There were prophets before, but Joseph has the spirit and power
of all the prophets.

President Brigham Young also spoke very pointedly and very truly about
Dr. Foster and others. Dr. Foster was cursed, and the people cried
"Amen."

Several persons were baptized in the river at the foot of Main street.

There was a meeting of the Twelve Apostles, Seventies and others, in
the Seventies' Hall, in the afternoon.

Prayer meeting in the evening: the brethren prayed for the sick, a
deliverance from our enemies, a favorable termination to lawsuits, &c.,
&c. I had been suddenly taken sick, and was therefore unable to attend.

A conference of Elders assembled at Yelrome, or Morley Settlement,
Lima, Isaac Morley presiding, when a quorum of High Priests was
organized, consisting of thirty-one members. Horace Rawson president,
Philip Gardner and Joseph S. Allen, his counselors, and James C. Snow,
clerk.

There was a meeting at Wilson Law's, near the sawmill, of those who had
been cut off from the Church, and their dupes. Several affidavits which
they had taken against me and others were read. William Law, Wilson
{347} Law, Austin A. Cowles, John Scott, Sen., Francis M. Higbee,
Robert D. Foster, and Robert Pierce were appointed a committee to visit
the different families in the city, and see who would join the new
church; _i.e._, as they had decided that I was a fallen prophet, &c.;
and they appointed William Law in my place, who chose Austin Cowles and
Wilson Law as his counselors. Robert D. Foster and Francis M. Higbee to
be two of the Twelve Apostles, &c., &c., as report says.

Elder James Blackeslee preached in the forenoon, bearing a faithful
testimony of the truth of the work and my being a true prophet, and in
the afternoon joined the "Anties." They chose Charles Ivins Bishop.

A conference was held in Sheffield, England, representing 215 members,
7 Elders, 19 Priests, 5 Teachers, and 3 Deacons.

_Monday, 29.--_At home; received a visit from L. R. Foster of New York,
who gave me a good pencil case, sent me by Brother Theodore Curtis,
who is now in New York; and the first words I wrote with it were, "God
bless the man!"

At 11 a.m., Robert D. Foster came up for trial. I transferred the case
to Alderman William Marks. Foster objected to the jurisdiction of the
court, also to an informality in the writ, &c.

The court decided he had not jurisdiction. Esquire Noble, from Rock
river, assisted the City Attorney. Esquire Patrick was present.

I called a special session of the City Council at 3:30 p.m., when it
was voted that W. W. Phelps take the place of John Taylor during his
absence this season; also Aaron Johnson in place of Orson Hyde; Phineas
Richards in place of Heber C. Kimball; Edward Hunter in place of Daniel
Spencer; Levi Richards in place of Brigham Young as councilors in the
City Council; and Elias Smith as alderman in place of George A. Smith.

Lieutenant Williams filed his affidavit _versus_ Major-General {348}
Wilson Law, and he was suspended from office to await his trial before
a court-martial of the Nauvoo Legion for ungentlemanly conduct, &c.;
and he was notified of his command in the Legion being suspended, and
Charles C. Rich was notified to take command, and also notified seven
officers to sit as a court-martial.

William Law was suspended for trial about the same time.

Steamer _Mermaid_ touched at Nauvoo House, landing at 5 p.m. for a
short time when going down.

John P. Greene published the following in the_ Neighbor:_ (Impression
of May 1st.)

    _The Foster-Higbee Embroilment_.

    All is peace at Nauvoo, among the Saints:

    But, Mr. Taylor, I wish you to give the following outrage an
    insertion in the _Neighbor_, that the public mind may be disabused,
    and the disgrace and shame fall on those who have justly deserved
    it and merited the people's rebuke!

    On Friday morning, the 26th inst., I was informed by Mr. Orrin P.
    Rockwell that one Mr. Augustine Spencer had committed an assault on
    the person of Alderman Orson Spencer, and the Mayor of the city had
    sent for Augustine Spencer, and found him in Mr. Marr's law office,
    made him a prisoner, and informed him he must go with me to the
    Mayor's office, when he said he would not go.

    I then called upon Robert D. Foster, Chauncey L. Higbee, and
    Charles A. Foster to assist me in taking said Spencer to the
    Mayor's office; but they swore they would not, and used many
    threatening oaths and aspersions, saying they would see the Mayor
    and the city damned, and then they would not; but soon followed
    me and Mr. Augustine Spencer to the office door, when the Mayor
    ordered me to arrest these three men for refusing to assist me in
    the discharge of my duty; and when attempting to arrest them, they
    all resisted, and with horrid imprecations threatened to shoot.

    I called for help, and there not being sufficient, the Mayor laid
    hold on the two Fosters at the same time. At that instant Charles
    A. Foster drew a double-barrel pistol on Mr. Smith, but it was
    instantly wrenched from his hand; and afterwards he declared he
    would have shot the Mayor, if we had let his pistol alone, and also
    he would thank God for the privilege of ridding the world of a
    tyrant! Chauncey L. Higbee responded to Foster's threats, and swore
    that he would do it.

    {349}

    However, the three were arrested and brought before the Mayor,
    whereupon Orrin P. Rockwell, Joseph Coolidge, John P. Greene and E.
    Tufts testified to the amount of the above statements; upon which
    evidence the court assessed a fine of one hundred dollars to each
    of the above-named aggressors, who appealed to the Municipal Court.

    I wish the public to know who it is that makes insurrections and
    disturbs the peace and quiet of the people of the city of Nauvoo;
    and in order to do this I need only to tell the world that this
    Robert D. Foster is a county magistrate, and the same Robert D.
    Foster that was fined for gambling a few weeks since; and that this
    Chauncey L. Higbee is a lawyer and notary public of Hancock county,
    and the same Chauncey L. Higbee that was fined for insulting the
    city officers (the marshal and constable) when in the discharge of
    their official duties, a few weeks since.

    "When the wicked rule the people mourn, but righteousness exalteth
    any nation"--SOLOMON.

    J. P. GREENE, City Marshal.

    N. B.--We wish it to be distinctly understood that neither of
    the three above-named individuals are members of the Church
    of Latter-day Saints, but we believe Charles A. Foster is a
    Methodist.--J. P. G.

_Tuesday, 30.--_At home counseling the brethren about many things;
received much company, &c.

In the afternoon in council with Hiram Clark and Brigham Young, at
Brigham Young's house, on the affairs of the Church in England.

A complaint was commenced against William and Wilson Law in the Masonic
Lodge, &c.

Sent notification to two more officers to sit in the court-martial on
the trial of William and Wilson Law.

The _Osprey_ steamer touched at the Nauvoo House landing in the evening.

_Wednesday, May 1.--_Heavy rain and wind last night.

At home counseling the brethren, and rode out a short time in the
afternoon with a gentleman from Quincy.

Elder Lyman Wight and Bishop George Miller arrived from the Pine
country.

Mr. Thomas A. Lyne, a tragedian from New York, assisted by George J.
Adams and others, got up a theatrical exhibition in the lower room of
the Masonic Hall, which was fitted {350} up with very tasteful scenery.
They performed "Pizarro," "The Orphan of Geneva," "Douglas," "The Idiot
Witness," "Damon and Pythias," and other plays with marked success. The
Hall was well attended each evening, and the audience expressed their
entire satisfaction and approbation.

_Thursday, 2.--_Very windy all night, breaking down large trees; a
thunder storm also.

At home and counseling the brethren.

Sent William Clayton to Wilson Law to find out why he refused paying
his note, when he brought in some claims as a set-off which Clayton
knew were paid, leaving me no remedy but the glorious uncertainty of
the law.

At 10 a.m. the _Maid of Iowa_ steamer started for Rock River for a load
of wheat and corn to feed the laborers on the Temple.

William Clayton and Colonel Stephen Markham started to attend court at
Dixon, on the case of "Joseph Smith vs. Harmon T. Wilson and Joseph H.
Reynolds."

In the afternoon I rode to the prairie to sell some land, and during my
absence Lucien Woodworth returned from Texas.

Lieut. Aaron Johnson made the following affidavit;

    NAUVOO, May 2nd, 1844.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS, HANCOCK CO.,

    CITY OF NAUVOO, ss

    Personally appeared before me, John Taylor, Judge-Advocate of the
    Nauvoo Legion, Aaron Johnson; and being duly sworn deposes and

    house of Wilson Law in Nauvoo aforesaid, Colonel R. D. Foster,
    Surgeon-in-Chief, and Brevet Brigadier-General of said Nauvoo
    Legion, while talking about General Joseph Smith, said that General
    Smith kept a gang of robbers and plunderers about his house for
    the purpose of robbing and plundering, and he (Smith) received
    half the spoils; also that said General Joseph Smith tried to get
    him (Foster) to go and kill Boggs, with many other ungentlemanly
    and unofficer-like observations concerning said General Smith and
    others.

    JOHN TAYLOR,

    Judge-Advocate of the Nauvoo Legion.

_Friday, 3.--_At home giving advice to brethren who were constantly
calling to ask for counsel. Several thunder showers during the day.

In general council from 2 to 6, and from 8 to 10 p.m. Lucien Woodworth
gave an account of his mission.

Wrote a letter to Uncle John Smith, and requested him to attend general
council next Monday.

The following letter was written:

    _Letter: Brigham Young and Willard Richards to Reuben
    Hedlock--Instructions on Immigration Matters_.

    NAUVOO, May 3rd, 1844.

    _Elder Reuben Hedlock_:

    DEAR BROTHER--Your long communication by Elder Kay was received two
    weeks last Saturday, also the one by Elder Clark last Saturday,
    and we feel to thank you for the care you have taken to write us
    so particularly. We are glad to receive such communications, and
    wish you to continue the same course as opportunities present. The
    brethren have all had good passages (four ships). Elder Clark was
    only five weeks and three days to New Orleans. All things safe.

    All things are going on gloriously at Nauvoo. We shall make a
    great wake in the nation. Joseph for President. Your family is
    well, and friends generally. We have already received several
    hundred volunteers to go out electioneering and preaching and more
    offering. We go for storming the nation. But we must proceed to
    realities.

    The whisperings of the Spirit to us are that you do well to content
    yourself awhile longer in old England, and let your wife remain
    where she is. We hope the Temple may be completed, say one year
    from this spring, when in many respects changes will take place.
    Until then, who can do better in England than yourself! But we will
    not leave you comfortless; we will send Elders to your assistance.
    For three or four months we want all the help we can get in the
    United States; after which you may expect help.

    In the meantime you are at liberty to print as many _Stars_,
    pamphlets hymn books, tracts, cards, &c., as you can sell; and make
    all the money you can in righteousness. Don't reprint everything
    you get from Nauvoo. Many things are printed here not best to
    circulate in England. Select and write doctrine, and matter, (new)
    such as will be {352} useful to the Saints in England and new to
    us; so that when we exchange papers all will be edified. God shall
    give you wisdom, if you will seek to Him, and you shall prosper in
    your printing.

    We also wish you to unfurl your flag on your shipping office, and
    send all the Saints you can to New York, or Boston, or Philadelphia
    or any other port of the United States, but not at our expense any
    longer. We have need of something to sustain us in our labors, and
    we want you to go ahead with printing and shipping, and make enough
    to support yourself and help us a bit. You will doubtless find it
    necessary to employ Brother Ward. Keep all your books straight, so
    that we in the end can know every particular.

    Ship everybody to America you can get the money for--Saint and
    sinner--a general shipping-office. And we would like to have our
    shipping-agent in Liverpool sleep on as good a bed, eat at as
    respectable a house, keep as genteel an office, and have his boots
    shine as bright, and blacked as often as any other office-keeper.
    Yes sir; make you money enough to wear a good broadcloth, and show
    the world that you represent gentlemen of worth, character and
    respectability.

    We will by-and-by have offices from the rivers to the ends of the
    earth, and we will begin at Liverpool from this time and increase
    and increase and _increase_ the business of the office as fast as
    it can be done in safety, and circumstances will permit. Employ a
    runner, if necessary, and show the world you can do a better and
    more honorable business than anybody else, and more of it. Don't be
    afraid to blow your trumpet.

    We need not say, deal with everybody so that they will want to deal
    with you again, and make all the money you honestly can. Send no
    more emigrants on emigration books or _Star_ money. Temple orders
    for emigrants may be filled on Temple funds. Keep account of all
    moneys in their separate departments and favor us with a report
    occasionally.

    Sell the Books of Mormon the first opportunity, if it be at a
    reduced price, and forward the money by the first safe conveyance
    to Brigham Young.

    We will pay your wife as you requested in your letter, as soon as
    possible. We wish you to take care of yourself and family, and
    withal help us besides; and we have now put you in possession of
    means to do it.

    Let nobody know your business but the underwriters. Our wives know
    not all our business, neither does any wise man's wife know all
    things, for the secret of the Lord is with those that fear Him and
    do His business. A hint to the wise is sufficient. But we will
    add, if you want us to do anything for your wife, write us, and we
    will do it; but {353} keep our business from your wife and from
    everybody else.

    We are glad to hear a door is open in France, and sure we have no
    objections to your going over and preaching, &c.; but we think
    perhaps you will now find as much to do in England as you can
    find time to do it in; if not, go by all means. We are in hopes
    of sending a special messenger to France in a few days; if so,
    very likely he may call on you, and you pass over and give him an
    introduction: this would be pleasant for you all.

    Brother Hedlock, a word with you privately. Joseph said, last
    conference, that Zion included all North and South America; and
    after the Temple was done, and the Elders endowed, they would
    spread and build up cities all over the United States; but at
    present we are not to teach this doctrine. Nay, hold your tongue.
    But by this you can see why it is wisdom for the Saints to get into
    the United States--anywhere rather than stay in England to starve.

    The prophet has a charter for a dam from the lower line of the city
    to the island opposite Montrose, and from thence to the sand-bar
    above in the Mississippi. Could five, six or seven thousand dollars
    be raised to commence the dam at the lower extremity, and erect
    a building, any machinery might be propelled by water. The value
    of a steam-engine would nearly build the dam sufficient for a
    cotton-factory, which we much need. Start some capitalists, if you
    can: 'tis the greatest speculation in the world: a world of cotton
    and woollen goods are wanted here.

    We have proposed to Brother Clark to return to your assistance in
    the shipping business soon; also to enter into exchanges of goods
    and produce. Which he will do, he has not decided. What will hinder
    your doing a good business in shipping this season? Good? Yes, in
    competing with the first offices in the city, and by next season
    taking the lead, if not this! When the Saints get to New York,
    Boston, &c., let them go to work, spread abroad in the land, or
    come to Nauvoo, as they and convenient and have means, and when the
    season arrives, start again for New Orleans. Write soon after the
    receipt of this, and let us know the prospect.

    Tell the Saints, when they arrive in America, to make themselves as
    comfortable as they can, and be diligent in business, and not be
    over anxious if they cannot come to Nauvoo. They will find Elders
    in all the states who will be ready to give them instruction; and
    if they can gather something by the way by their industry to assist
    themselves with when they arrive here, it will be well for them.

    We have dropped the Nauvoo House until the Temple can be completed,
    and the Temple is going on finely. We have had an open winter and a
    forward spring. The Twelve are holding general conferences all over
    the United States. They will go East soon, and Brother Young {354}
    will write to you as soon as he gets the information to tell what
    house you can remit the book money to in New York.

    We shall have a State Convention at Nauvoo on the 17th inst.,--an
    election. A great many are believing the doctrine. If any of the
    brethren wish to go to Texas, we have no particular objection. You
    may send a hundred thousand there if you can, in eighteen months,
    though we expect before that you will return to receive your
    endowments; and then we will consult your interest, with others who
    may be going abroad, about taking their families with them.

    The kingdom is organized; and, although as yet no bigger than
    a grain of mustard seed, the little plant is in a flourishing
    condition, and our prospects brighter than ever. Cousin Lemuel is
    very friendly, and cultivating the spirit of peace and union in his
    family very extensively.

    William and Wilson Law, Robert D. Foster, Chauncey L. and Francis
    Higbee, Father Cowles, &c., have organized a new church. (Laws
    and Fosters were first cut off). William Law is Prophet; James
    Blakesley and Cowles, Counselors; Higbee and Foster of the Twelve.
    Cannot learn all particulars. Charles Ivins, Bishop; old Dr. Green
    and old John Scott, his counselors. They are talking of sending a
    mission to England, but it will probably be after this when they
    come among you. 'Tis the same old story over again--"The doctrine
    is right, but Joseph is a fallen prophet."

    Your brethren in the new covenant,

    BRIGHAM YOUNG,

    WILLARD RICHARDS.

Elder Parley P. Pratt wrote from Richmond, Mass., as follows:

    _Letter: Parley P. Pratt to Joseph Smith et al., Denouncing
    Augustine Spencer_.

    _Dear Brother Joseph and Brother Orson Spencer, or whom it may
    concern_:

    This is to forewarn you that you have a snake in the grass--a base
    traitor and hypocrite in your midst, of whom perhaps you may not be
    fully aware. You may think these harsh terms, but I speak from good
    evidence and speak the truth.

    Mr. Augustine Spencer, brother to Elder Orson Spencer, has written
    a letter from Nauvoo, which is now going the rounds in this
    neighborhood, and is fraught with the most infamous slander and
    lies concerning Joseph Smith and others, and which is calculated to
    embitter the minds of the people who read or hear it. It affirms
    that Joseph Smith is in the habit of drinking, swearing, carousing,
    dancing all night, &c., {355} and that he keeps six or seven young
    females as wives, &c., and many other such like insinuations.

    At the same time he cautions the people to whom he writes to
    keep the letter in such a way that a knowledge of its contents
    may not reach Nauvoo, as he says he is on intimate terms and
    confidential friendship with the "Prophet Joe" and the Mormons,
    and that he hopes to get into office by their means. This is his
    own acknowledgment of his own baseness, imposition and hypocrisy.
    I have not seen the letter myself, but have carefully examined the
    testimony of those who have, and I have also seen and witnessed its
    baneful effect upon the people here.

    Now, I say to the Saints, Let such a man alone severely; shun him
    as they would the pestilence; be not deceived by a smooth tongue
    nor flattering words; neither accept of any excuse or apology until
    he boldly contradicts and counteracts his lying words abroad; but
    rather expose and unmask him in your midst, that he may be known
    and consequently become powerless, if he is not already so. I am
    well and expect to be in Boston tomorrow.

    I remain, as ever, your friend and brother, in the love of truth,

    P. P. PRATT.

    upon the petition of Joseph Smith, Sen., as follows:

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO, Sct.

    _To the Honorable Municipal Court and for the City of Nauvoo_:

    The undersigned, your petitioner, most respectfully represents
    that he is an inhabitant of said city. Your petitioner further
    represents that he is under arrest in said city, and is now in
    the custody of one John D. Parker, deputy sheriff of the county
    of Hancock, and state of {358} Illinois; and that the said Parker
    holds your petitioner by a writ of _Capias ad respondendum,_ issued
    by the clerk of the Circuit Court of the county of Hancock and
    state of Illinois, at the instance of one Francis M. Higbee of
    said county, requiring your petitioner to answer the said Francis
    M. Higbee, "of a plea of the case;" damage, five thousand dollars.
    Your petitioner further represents that the proceedings against him
    are illegal; that the said warrant of arrest is informal, and not
    of that character which the law recognizes as valid; that the said
    writ is wanting and deficient in the plea therein contained; that
    the charge or complaint which your petitioner is therein required
    to answer is not known to the law.

    Your petitioner further avers that the said writ does not disclose
    in any way or manner whatever any cause of action; which matter
    your petitioner most respectfully submits for your consideration,
    together with a copy of the said warrant of arrest which is
    hereunto attached.

    Your petitioner further states that this proceeding has been
    instituted against him without any just or legal cause; and further
    that the said Francis M. Higbee is actuated by no other motive
    than a desire to persecute and harass your petitioner for the
    base purpose of gratifying feelings of revenge, which, without
    any cause, the said Francis M. Higbee has for a long time been
    fostering and cherishing.

    Your petitioner further states that he is not guilty of the charge
    preferred against him, or of any act against him, by which the said
    Francis M. Higbee could have any charge, claim or demand whatever
    against your petitioner.

    Your petitioner further states that he verily believes that another
    object the said F. M. Higbee had in instituting the proceeding was
    and is to throw your petitioner into the hands of his enemies, that
    he might the better carry out a conspiracy which has for some time
    been brewing against the life of your petitioner.

    Your petitioner further states that the suit which has been
    instituted against him has been instituted through malice, private
    pique and corruption.

    Your petitioner would therefore most respectfully ask your
    honorable body to grant him the benefit of the writ of _habeas
    corpus,_ that the whole matter may be thoroughly investigated, and
    such order made as the law and justice demand in the premises: and
    your petitioner with ever pray.

    SIR.--You will please to take notice that Joseph Smith, Senior, has
    petitioned for a writ of _habeas corpus_ from the Municipal Court
    of said city, praying that he may be liberated from the custody
    of John D. Parker, deputy sheriff of Hancock county, by whom he
    is held in custody on a _capias ad respondendum,_ issued by the
    Circuit Court of Hancock county, on the first day of May instant,
    to answer Francis M. Higbee on a plea of the case, etc.; which writ
    is granted; and you will have the opportunity to appear before the
    Municipal Court at 10 o'clock a.m. on the 7th of May instant, at
    the Council Chamber in said city, and show cause why said Joseph
    Smith, Senior, should not be liberated on said_ habeas corpus_.

    [Sidenote: [Seal]]

    Witness my hand and seal, of court this 5th day of May, 1844.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, CLERK M. C. C. N.

    The case was argued at length by Messrs. George P. Styles and
    Sidney Rigdon. After which the court allowed the petitioner and his
    counsel to proceed with the case. Whereupon President Joseph Smith,
    Brigham Young, Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, Orrin Porter Rockwell,
    Cyrus H. Wheelock, Joel S. Miles, Henry G. Sherwood, Heber C.
    Kimball, were permitted to testify proving (1) the very bad and
    immoral character of Francis M. Higbee; and (2) the maliciousness
    of his prosecution of Joseph Smith. In the course of his testimony
    the Prophet said: "The only sin I ever committed was in exercising
    sympathy and covering up their [the Higbees', Fosters', Laws' and
    Dr. Bennett's] iniquities, on their solemn promise to reform, and
    of this I am {361} ashamed, and will never do so again." After
    hearing these witnesses the Judge said: "It is considered and
    ordained by the court--

    "1st. That the said Joseph Smith, Senior, be discharged from the
    said arrest and imprisonment complained of in said petition, on the
    illegality of the writ upon which he was arrested, as well as upon
    the writ of the case, and that he go hence without day.

    "2nd. Francis M. Higbee's character having been so fully shown as
    infamous, the court is convinced that this suit was instituted
    through malice, private pique, and corruption, and ought not to be
    countenanced; and it is ordained by the court that the said Francis
    M. Higbee pay the costs."

    [Sidenote: [Seal]]

    In testimony whereof I hereunto set my hand and affix the seal of
    said court at the city of Nauvoo, this 8th day of May, 1844.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, Clerk.

I copy the following from the _Neighbor_ of this date:

    _Hurrah for the General!_ The following which we extract from the
    _St. Louis Organ,_ shows how the public mind is turning, and what
    their feelings are in regard to the Prophet, his views and theirs
    also in regard to the Presidency.

    _Forebear awhile--we'll hear a little more._ The matter is now
    settled with Messrs. Clay, Tyler and Van Buren. Let Mr. Clay
    return at once from his political perambulations in the South, Mr.
    Tyler abandon his hopes of re-election by aid of the "immediate
    annexation" of Texas, and let Mr. Van Buren be quiet at Kinderhook,
    that he may watch the operations of the "sober second thought" of
    the people!

    General Joseph Smith, the acknowledged modern Prophet, has got them
    all in the rear; and from the common mode of testing the success
    of candidates for the Presidency, to wit., by steamboat elections,
    he (Smith) will beat all the other aspirants to that office two to
    one. We learn from the polls of the steamboat _Osprey_, on her last
    trip to this city, that the vote stood for General Joseph Smith, 20
    gents and 5 ladies; Henry Clay, 16 gents and 4 ladies; Van Buren, 7
    gents and 0 ladies.

Attended theatre in the evening.

CHAPTER XVI.

ADDRESS OF THE PROPHET--HIS PROPHETIC CALLING AND THE
RESURRECTION--STATUS OF AFFAIRS AT NAUVOO--HYDE'S REPORTS FROM
WASHINGTON ON THE WESTERN MOVEMENT--OREGON.

_Thursday, May 9, 1844.--_A court-martial was held in my office for the
trial of Major-General Wilson Law, on a charge of ungentlemanly and
unofficer-like conduct. Present--Generals Hyrum Smith, Charles C. Rich,
Lyman Wight, George Miller and Albert P. Rockwood; Cols. John Scott and
Hosea Stout; Judge-Advocate John Taylor; and Secretary Thomas Bullock.
The charge was sustained and Wilson Law cashiered.

[Sidenote: Theatricals in Nauvoo.]

Evening, attended theatre, and saw "Damon and Pythias" and "The Idiot
Witness" performed.

Elders Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith called upon me this
morning, and said they were ready to start on their mission to attend
the conferences appointed throughout the north of Illinois, Indiana and
Michigan. I blessed them in the name of the Lord, and told them to go,
and they should prosper and always prosper. They left in company with
Elders Jedediah M. Grant and Ezra Thayer.

_Friday, 10--_Rode out after breakfast to the prairie to sell some land
to some brethren.

The court-martial was held in the Mayor's office on the charge against
Robert D. Foster, Surgeon-General, for unbecoming and unofficer-like
conduct, &c.; Brigadier-General George Miller presiding. The charges
were sustained.

{363} A prospectus of the _Nauvoo Expositor_ was distributed among the
people by the apostates.

The jury of Lee county, Illinois, awarded $40 damages and the
costs against Joseph H. Reynolds and Harmon T. Wilson for illegal
imprisonment and abuse, which I suffered from them last June in that
county.

_Saturday, 11.--_At 10 a.m. I attended City Council, and stayed till
half-past eleven; but there not being a quorum, adjourned until next
regular session. At 1 p.m. at my office, and had a conversation with
Mr. Lyne on the theatre; and at 6 p.m. attended prayer meeting; John P.
Greene and Sidney Rigdon present. Several showers of rain during the
day. The Nauvoo Legion had a company muster.

_Sunday, 12.--_At 10 a.m. I preached at the Stand. The following brief
synopsis of my discourse was reported by my clerk, Thomas Bullock:

    _President Joseph Smith's Address--Defense of his Prophetic
    Calling--Resurrection of the Dead--Fullness of Ordinances Necessary
    Both for the Living and Dead_.

    The Savior has the words of eternal life. Nothing else can profit
    us. There is no salvation in believing an evil report against our
    neighbor. I advise all to go on to perfection, and search deeper
    and deeper into the mysteries of Godliness. A man can do nothing
    for himself unless God direct him in the right way; and the
    priesthood is for that purpose.

    The last time I spoke on this stand it was on the resurrection of
    the dead, when I promised to continue my remarks upon that subject.
    I still feel a desire to say something on this subject. Let us this
    very day begin anew, and now say, with all our hearts, we will
    forsake our sins and be righteous. I shall read the 24th chapter
    of Matthew, and give it a literal rendering and reading; and when
    it is rightly understood, it will be edifying. [He then read and
    translated it from the German].

    I thought the very oddity of its rendering would be edifying
    anyhow--_"And it will preached be, the Gospel of the kingdom, in
    the whole world, to a witness over all people: and then will the
    end come."_ I will now read it in German [which he did, and many
    Germans who were present said he translated it correctly].

    The Savior said when these tribulations should take place, it
    should be committed to a man who should be a witness over the whole
    world: {364} the keys of knowledge, power and revelations should be
    revealed to a witness who should hold the testimony to the world.
    It has always been my province to dig up hidden mysteries--new
    things--for my hearers. Just at the time when some men think that
    I have no right to the keys of the Priesthood--just at that time
    I have the greatest right. The Germans are an exalted people. The
    old German translators are the most correct--most honest of any of
    the translators; and therefore I get testimony to bear me out in
    the revelations that I have preached for the last fourteen years.
    The old German, Latin, Greek and Hebrew translations all say it is
    true: they cannot be impeached, and therefore I am in good company.

    All the testimony is that the Lord in the last days would commit
    the keys of the priesthood to a witness over all people. Has the
    Gospel of the kingdom commenced in the last days? And will God
    take it from the man until He takes him Himself? I have read it
    precisely as the words flowed from the lips of Jesus Christ. John
    the Revelator saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven,
    having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
    earth.

    The scripture is ready to be fulfilled when great wars, famines,
    pestilence, great distress, judgments, &c., are ready to be poured
    out on the inhabitants of the earth. John saw the angel having
    the holy priesthood, who should preach the everlasting Gospel to
    all nations. God had an angel--a special messenger--ordained and
    prepared for that purpose in the last days. Woe, woe be to that man
    or set of men who lift up their hands against God and His witness
    in these last days: for they shall deceive almost the very chosen
    ones!

    My enemies say that I _have_ been a true prophet. Why, I had rather
    be a fallen true prophet than a false prophet. When a man goes
    about prophesying, and commands men to obey his teachings, he must
    either be a true or false prophet. False prophets always arise to
    oppose the true prophets and they will prophesy so very near the
    truth that they will deceive almost the very chosen ones.

    The doctrine of eternal judgments belongs to the first principles
    of the Gospel, in the last days. In relation to the kingdom of
    God, the devil always sets up his kingdom at the very same time in
    opposition to God. Every man who has a calling to minister to the
    inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the
    Grand Council of heaven before this world was. I suppose that I
    was ordained to this very office in that Grand Council. It is the
    testimony that I want that I am God's servant, and this people His
    people. The ancient prophets declared that in the last days the God
    of heaven should set up a kingdom which should never be destroyed,
    nor left to other people; and the very time that was calculated on,
    this people were struggling to bring it out. He that arms himself
    with gun, sword, or pistol, except in the {365} defense of truth,
    will sometime be sorry for it. I never carry any weapon with me
    bigger than my penknife. When I was dragged before the cannon and
    muskets in Missouri, I was unarmed. God will always protect me
    until my mission is fulfilled.

    I calculate to be one of the instruments of setting up the kingdom
    of Daniel by the word of the Lord, and I intend to lay a foundation
    that will revolutionize the whole world. I once offered my life to
    the Missouri mob as a sacrifice for my people, and here I am. It
    will not be by sword or gun that this kingdom will roll on: the
    power of truth is such that all nations will be under the necessity
    of obeying the Gospel. The prediction is that army will be against
    army: it may be that the Saints will have to beat their ploughs
    into swords, for it will not do for men to sit down patiently and
    see their children destroyed.

    My text is on the resurrection of the dead, which you will
    find in the 14th chapter of John--"In my Father's house are
    many mansions." It should be--"In my Father's kingdom are many
    kingdoms," in order that ye may be heirs of God and joint-heirs
    with me. I do not believe the Methodist doctrine of sending honest
    men and noble-minded men to hell, along with the murderer and the
    adulterer. They may hurl all their hell and fiery billows upon me,
    for they will roll off me as fast as they come on. But I have an
    order of things to save the poor fellows at any rate, and get them
    saved; for I will send men to preach to them in prison and save
    them if I can.

    There are mansions for those who obey a celestial law, and there
    are other mansions for those who come short of the law, every man
    in his own order. There is baptism, &c., for those to exercise who
    are alive, and baptism for the dead who die without the knowledge
    of the Gospel.

    I am going on in my progress for eternal life. It is not only
    necessary that you should be baptized for your dead, but you will
    have to go through all the ordinances for them, the same as you
    have gone through to save yourselves. There will be 144,000 saviors
    on Mount Zion, and with them an innumerable host that no man can
    number. Oh! I beseech you to go forward, go forward and make your
    calling and your election sure; and if any man preach any other
    Gospel than that which I have preached, he shall be cursed; and
    some of you who now hear me shall see it, and know that I testify
    the truth concerning them.

    In regard to the law of the priesthood, there should be a place
    where all nations shall come up from time to time to receive their
    endowments; and the Lord has said this shall be the place for
    the baptisms for the dead. Every man that has been baptized and
    belongs to the kingdom has a right to be baptized for those who
    have gone before; and as soon as the law of the Gospel is obeyed
    here by their friends who act as proxy for them, the Lord has
    administrators there to set them free. {366} A man may act as proxy
    for his own relatives; the ordinances of the Gospel which were laid
    out before the foundations of the world have thus been fulfilled by
    them, and we may be baptized for those whom we have much friendship
    for; but it must first be revealed to the man of God, lest we
    should run too far. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall
    all be made alive;" all shall be raised from the dead. The Lamb of
    God hath brought to pass the resurrection, so that all shall rise
    from the dead.

    God Almighty Himself dwells in eternal fire; flesh and blood cannot
    go there, for all corruption is devoured by the fire. "Our God is a
    consuming fire." When our flesh is quickened by the Spirit, there
    will be no blood in this tabernacle. Some dwell in higher glory
    than others.

    Those who have done wrong always have that wrong gnawing them.
    Immortality dwells in everlasting burnings. I will from time to
    time reveal to you the subjects that are revealed by the Holy Ghost
    to me. All the lies that are now hatched up against me are of the
    devil, and the influence of the devil and his servants will be used
    against the kingdom of God. The servants of God teach nothing but
    principles of eternal life, by their works ye shall know them. A
    good man will speak good things and holy principles, and an evil
    man evil things. I feel, in the name of the Lord, to rebuke all
    such bad principles, liars, &c., and I warn all of you to look out
    whom you are going after. I exhort you to give heed to all the
    virtue and the teachings which I have given you. All men who are
    immortal dwell in everlasting burnings. You cannot go anywhere but
    where God can find you out. All men are born to die, and all men
    must rise; all must enter eternity.

    In order for you to receive your children to yourselves you must
    have a promise--some ordinance; some blessing, in order to ascend
    above principalities, or else it may be an angel. They must rise
    just as they died; we can there hail our lovely infants with the
    same glory--the same loveliness in the celestial glory, where they
    all enjoy alike. They differ in stature, in size, the same glorious
    spirit gives them the likeness of glory and bloom; the old man
    with his silvery hairs will glory in bloom and beauty. No man can
    describe it to you--no man can write it.

    When did I ever teach anything wrong from this stand? When was I
    ever confounded? I want to triumph in Israel before I depart hence
    and am no more seen. I never told you I was perfect; but there is
    no error in the revelations which I have taught. Must I, then, be
    thrown away as a thing of naught?

    I enjoin for your consideration--add to your faith virtue, love,
    &c. I say, in the name of the Lord, if these things are in you, you
    shall be {367} fruitful. I testify that no man has power to reveal
    it but myself--things in heaven, in earth and hell; and all shut
    your mouths for the future. I commend you all to God, that you may
    inherit all things; and may God add His blessing. Amen.

My brother Hyrum and Elder Lyman Wight also addressed the Saints.

My brother Hyrum received an anonymous letter, supposed to have been
written by Joseph H. Jackson, threatening his life, and calling upon
him to make his peace with God for he would soon have to die.

At 3 p.m. I attended prayer meeting in the council room. William Smith
and Almon W. Babbitt were present. The room was full and we all prayed
for deliverance from our enemies and exaltation to such offices as will
enable the servants of God to execute righteousness in the earth.

I copy the following from the _Times and Seasons_:

    FOR THE NEIGHBOR.

    _Nauvoo and President Smith_.

    Before taking my farewell of your beautiful and growing city, I
    avail myself of a few leisure moments in expressing some of my
    views and conclusions of the "Prophet Joe" and the Mormons. In the
    first place, allow me to say that the Mormons, as a people, have
    been most woe fully misrepresented and abused, and, in ninety-nine
    instances out of a hundred, by persons who know nothing of their
    principles and doctrines.

    Before visiting the place, my mind was very much prejudiced against
    the Mormons, from reports which I had listened to in traveling
    through the different states; and I presume, if I had never taken
    occasion to inform myself of their religion and views, my mind
    would have remained in the same condition. There is not a city
    within my knowledge that can boast of a more enterprising and
    industrious people than Nauvoo. Her citizens are enlightened, and
    possess many advantages in the arts and sciences of the day, which
    other cities of longer standing cannot boast: in a word, Nauvoo
    bids fair to soon outrival any city in the West.

    General Smith is a man who understands the political history of his
    country as well as the religious history of the world, as perfectly
    as any politician or religionist I have ever met with. He advances
    ideas which if carried into effect would greatly benefit the nation
    in point of commerce {368} and finance; and while he maintains and
    philosophically shows that our country is approaching a fearful
    crisis, which, if not arrested, will end in disgrace to the
    country, and cause our national banner to hug its mast in disgust
    and shame, clearly points out the remedy.

    Shall the liberty which our fathers purchased at so dear a price
    be wrenched from the hand of their children? Shall our national
    banner, which floated so proudly in the breeze at the Declaration
    of Independence, be disgraced and refuse to show its motto? Shall
    we, as American citizens, fold our arms and look quietly on, while
    the shackles of slavery are being fastened upon our hands, and
    while men only seek office for the purpose of exalting themselves
    into power? I say, shall we still rush blindly on and hasten on
    our own destruction by placing men in power who neither regard the
    interests of the people nor the prayers of the oppressed? Every
    American citizen will shout at the top of his voice--no!

    Mr. Smith's "Views of the Powers and Policy of the Government"
    manifest a Republican spirit, and if carried out, would soon place
    the nation in a prosperous condition and brighten the prospects
    of those who now toil so incessantly to support the profligate
    expenditures and luxurious equipage of the present rulers and
    representatives of our nation.

    Joseph Smith is a man who is in every way calculated to make a free
    people happy. He is liberal in his sentiments and allows every man
    the free expression of his feelings on all subjects; he is sociable
    and easy in his manners, is conversant and familiar on all exciting
    topics, expresses himself freely and plainly on the different
    methods of administering the Government, while he is not ashamed to
    let the world know his views and criticize upon his opinions.

    I am, sir, in no way connected with the Mormon Church, but am
    disposed to listen to reason in all cases. I have heretofore been a
    warm advocate of the measures of the Whig party; but, considering
    General Smith's views and sentiments to be worthy the applause of
    every citizen of the United States, and especially the yeomanry of
    the country, I shall in every instance advocate his principles and
    use my utmost influence in his favor. I am, sir, yours in haste,

    AN AMERICAN.

    NAUVOO MANSION, May 12, 1844.

_Monday 13.--_Heavy thunder showers during the night. At 10 a.m. went
to my office and conversed with several of the brethren. Sold Ellis M.
Sanders one hundred acres of land, received $300 in cash, and his note
for $1,000, and $20 for the Temple. Paid Sisson Chase $298 and {369}
took up a note of Young, Kimball & Taylor, given for money they had
borrowed for me; and gave $10 to Heber C. Kimball.

At 2 p.m. attended meeting of the general council, at which the
following letter from Orson Hyde was read:

    _Letter: Elder Orson Hyde's Report of Labors in Washington:
    President Smith's Memorial for Western Movement Before Congressmen_.

    WASHINGTON, April 25, 1844.

    HONORED SIR:--I take the liberty to transmit through you to
    the council of our Church the result of my labors thus far. I
    arrived in this place on the 23rd instant, by way of Pittsburgh,
    Philadelphia, and New Jersey.

    I found Elder Orson Pratt here, Elder Page having been called home
    to Pittsburgh on account of his wife's ill health. Elder Orson
    Pratt has been indefatigable in his exertions in prosecuting the
    business entrusted to his charge. His business has been before the
    Senate, and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary; and the
    report of said committee is not yet rendered, which is the cause of
    his delay in writing to you.

    Yesterday we conversed with Messrs. Hoge, Hardin, Douglas and
    Wentworth; and last evening we spent several hours with the Hon.
    Mr. [James] Semple. [1] They all appear deeply interested in the
    Oregon question, and received us with every demonstration of
    respect that we could desire. Mr. Hoge thought the bill would not
    pass, from the fact that there already exists between England and
    America a treaty for the joint occupancy of Oregon, and that any
    act of our government authorizing an armed force to be raised,
    and destined for that country, would be regarded by England as
    an infraction of that treaty, and a cause of her commencing
    hostilities against us.

    But my reply was: These volunteers are not to be considered any
    part or portion of the army of the United States, neither acting
    under the direction or authority of the United States; and, said I,
    for men to go there and settle in the character of emigrants cannot
    be regarded by our government as deviating in the least degree from
    her plighted faith, unless she intends to tamely submit to British
    monopoly in that country.

    Mr. Hoge said he would present the memorial, if we desired it. I
    thanked him for his kind offer, but observed that I was not yet
    prepared for the bill to be submitted, but wished to elicit all the
    facts relative to the condition of Oregon, and also advise with
    many other members relative to the matter; and we could better
    determine then how the bill {370} should be introduced. We do not
    want it presented and referred to a standing committee, and stuck
    away with five or ten cords of petitions, and that be the last of
    it; but we want the memorial read, a move made to suspend the rules
    of the House, and the bill printed, &c.

    Mr. Wentworth said, "I am for Oregon, any how. You may set me down
    on your list, and I will go for you if you will go for Oregon."

    Judge Douglas has been quite ill, but is just recovered; he will
    help all he can; Mr. Hardin likewise. But Major Semple says that
    he does not believe anything will be done about Texas or Oregon
    this session, for it might have a very important effect upon the
    presidential election; and politicians are slow to move when such
    doubtful and important matters are likely to be effected by it.
    He says that there are already two bills before the House for
    establishing a territorial government in Oregon, and to protect
    the emigrants there; and now, he says, "Were your bill to be
    introduced, it might be looked upon that you claimed the sole right
    of emigrating to and settling the new country to the exclusion of
    others. He was in favor of the Oregon being settled, and he thought
    the bills already before the House would extend equal protection to
    us; and equal protection to every class of citizens was what the
    Government could rightly do, but particular privileges to any one
    class they could not rightly do."

    I observed that the bill asks for no exclusive rights. It asks not
    for exclusive rights in Oregon, neither do we wish it. Other people
    might make a move to Oregon, and no prejudices bar their way, and
    their motives would not be misinterpreted.

    But, said I, Missouri knows her guilt; and should we attempt to
    march to Oregon without the government throwing a protective shield
    over us, Missouri's crimes would lead her first to misinterpret
    our intentions, to fan the flame of popular excitement against
    us, and scatter the firebrands of a misguided zeal among the
    combustible materials of other places, creating a flame too hot
    for us to encounter--too desolating for us to indulge the hope of
    successfully prosecuting the grand and benevolent enterprise we
    have conceived. [2] We have been compelled to {371} relinquish our
    rights in Missouri. We have been forcibly driven from our homes,
    leaving our property and inheritances as spoil to the oppressor;
    and more or less in Illinois we have been subject to the whims
    and chimeras of illiberal men, and to threats, to vexatious
    prosecutions and lawsuits.

    Our government professes to have no power to help us, or to redress
    the wrongs which we have suffered; and we now ask the government
    to protect us while raising our volunteers. And when we get into
    Oregon we will protect ourselves and all others who wish our
    protection. And after subduing a new country, encountering all
    its difficulties and hardships, and sustaining the just claims
    of our nation to its soil, we believe that the generosity of
    our government towards us will be equal to our enterprise and
    patriotism; and that they will allow us a grant or territory of
    land, which will be both honorable to them and satisfactory to us.

    This, he says, is all very just and reasonable. But still he thinks
    that Congress will take no step in relation to Oregon, from the
    fact that his resolution requesting the President of the United
    States to give notice to the British Government for the abolition
    of the treaty of joint occupation was voted down; and while that
    treaty is in force, our government dare do nothing in relation to
    that country. This resolution was introduced by Mr. Semple to pave
    the way for the passage of those bills in relation to a territorial
    government in Oregon.

    All our members [Illinois delegation] join in the acknowledgment
    that you now have an undoubted right to go to Oregon with all the
    emigrants you can raise. They say the existing laws protect you as
    much as law can protect you; and should Congress pass an additional
    law, it would not prevent wicked men from shooting you down as they
    did in Missouri. All the Oregon men in Congress would be glad we
    would go to that country and settle it.

    I will now give you my opinion in relation to this matter. It
    is made up from the spirit of the times in a hasty manner,
    nevertheless I think time will prove it to be correct:--That
    Congress will pass no act in relation to Texas or Oregon at
    present. She is afraid of England, afraid of Mexico, afraid the
    Presidential election will be twisted by it. The members all appear
    like unskillful players at checkers--afraid to move, for they see
    not which way to move advantageously. All are figuring and play
    round the grand and important questions. In the days of our Lord
    the people neglected the weightier matters of the law, but tithed
    mint, rue, anise and cumin; but I think here in Washington they do
    little else than tithe the _mint_.

    A member of Congress is in no enviable situation; if he will
    boldly advocate true principles, he loses his influence and
    becomes unpopular; {372} and whoever is committed and has lost his
    influence has no power to benefit his constituents, so that all go
    to figuring and playing around the great points.

    Mr. Semple said that Mr. Smith could not constitutionally be
    constituted a member of the army by law; and this, if nothing
    else, would prevent its passage. I observed that I would in that
    case strike out that clause. Perhaps I took an unwarrantable
    responsibility upon myself; but where I get into a straight place I
    can do no better than act according to what appears most correct.

    I do not intend the opinion that I have hastily given shall abate
    my zeal to drive the matter through, but I have given the opinion
    for your benefit that your indulgence of the hope that Congress
    will do something for us may not cause you to delay any important
    action.

    There is already a government established in Oregon to some extent;
    magistrates have been chosen by the people, &c. This is on the
    south of the Columbia. North of that river the Hudson Bay Company
    occupy. There is some good country in Oregon, but a great deal of
    sandy, barren desert. I have seen a gentleman who has been there,
    and also in California.

    The most of the settlers in Oregon and Texas are our old enemies,
    the mobocrats of Missouri. If, however, the settlement of Oregon
    and Texas be determined upon, the sooner the move is made the
    better; and I would not advise any delay for the action of our
    government, for there is such jealousy of our rising power already,
    that government will do nothing to favor us. If the Saints possess
    the kingdom I think they will have to take it; and the sooner it is
    done the more easily it is accomplished.

    Your superior wisdom must determine whether to go to Oregon, to
    Texas, or to remain within these United States, and send forth
    the most efficient men to build up churches, and let them remain
    the time being; and in the meantime send some wise men among the
    Indians, and teach them civilization and religion, to cultivate
    the soil, to live in peace with one another and with all men. But
    whatever you do, don't be deluded with the hope that government
    will foster us and thus delay an action for which the present
    perhaps is the most proper time that ever will be.

    Oregon is becoming a popular question: the fever of emigration
    begins to rage. If the Mormons become the early majority, others
    will not come; if the Mormons do not become the early majority, the
    others will not allow us to come.

    Elder Pratt is faithful, useful and true; he has got the run of
    matters here very well, and is with me in all my deliberations,
    visitings, &c.

    Major Semple goes with us this evening to introduce us to the
    President and to view the White House.

    {373} My heart and hand are with you. May heaven bless you and me.
    As ever, I am

    ORSON HYDE.

    To the Council of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Also the following letter:

    _Letter: Orson Hyde's Second Letter from Washington Anent the
    Western Movement of the Church--the Probable Route_.

    WASHINGTON, April 26, 1844.

    DEAR SIR:--Today I trouble you with another communication, which
    you will please have the goodness to lay before our council.

    We were last evening introduced to the President at the White
    House by the politeness of Major Semple, where we spent an hour
    very agreeably. The President is a very plain, homespun, familiar,
    farmer-like man. He spoke of our troubles in Missouri, and
    regretted that we had met with such treatment. He asked us how we
    were getting along in Illinois. I told him that we were contending
    with the difficulties of a new country, and laboring under
    disadvantageous consequences of being driven from our property and
    homes in Missouri.

    We have this day had a long conversation with Judge Douglas. He
    is ripe for Oregon and the California. He said he would resign
    his seat in Congress if he could command the force that Mr. Smith
    could, and would be on the march to the country in a month.

    I learn that the eyes of many aspiring politicians in this place
    are upon that country, and that there is so much jealousy between
    them that they will probably pass no bill in relation to it.
    Now all these politicians rely upon the arm of the government
    to protect them there; and if government were to pass an act
    establishing a Territorial Government west of the Rocky Mountains
    there would be at once a tremendous rush of emigration; but if
    government pass no act in relation to it, these men have not
    stamina or sufficient confidence in themselves and their own
    resources to hazard the enterprise.

    The Northern Whig members are almost to a man against Texas and
    Oregon; but should the present administration succeed in annexing
    Texas, then all the Whigs would turn around in favor of Oregon;
    for if Texas be admitted slavery is extended to the South; then
    free states must be added to the West to keep up a balance of power
    between the slave and the free states.

    Should Texas be admitted, war with Mexico is looked upon as
    inevitable. The Senate have been in secret session on the
    ratification of the treaty of annexation; but what they did we
    cannot say. General Gaines who was boarding at the same house with
    Judge Douglas, was secretly {374} ordered to repair to the Texan
    frontier four days ago, and left immediately. I asked Judge Douglas
    if that did not speak loud for annexation. He says no. Santa Anna,
    being a jealous, hot-headed pate, might be suspicious the treaty
    would be ratified by the Senate, and upon mere suspicion might
    attempt some hostilities, and Gaines has been ordered there to be
    on the alert and ready for action, if necessary. Probably our navy
    will in a few days be mostly in the Gulf of Mexico.

    There are many powerful checks upon our government, preventing her
    from moving in any of these important matters; and for aught I know
    these checks are permitted to prevent our government from extending
    her jurisdiction over the territory which God designs to give to
    His Saints. Judge Douglas says he would equally as soon go to that
    country without an act of Congress as with; "and that in five years
    a noble state might be formed; and then if they would not receive
    us into the Union, we would have a government of our own." He is
    decidedly of the opinion that Congress will pass no act in favor of
    any particular man going there; but he says if any man will go and
    desires that privilege, and has confidence in his own ability to
    perform it, he already has the right, and the sooner he is off the
    better for his scheme.

    It is the opinion here among politicians that it will be extremely
    difficult to have any bill pass in relation to the encouragement of
    emigration to Oregon; but much more difficult to get a bill passed
    designating any particular man to go. But all concur in the opinion
    that we are authorized already.

    In case of a removal to that country, Nauvoo is the place of
    general rendezvous. Our course from thence would be westward
    through Iowa bearing a little north until we came to the Missouri
    River, leaving the state of Missouri on the left, thence onward,
    until we came to the Platte, thence up the north fork of the Platte
    to the mouth of the Sweetwater river in longitude 107 degree, 45
    W.; and thence up said Sweetwater river to the South Pass of the
    Rocky Mountains, about eleven hundred miles from Nauvoo; and from
    said South Pass, in latitude 42 degrees 28 north, to the Umpqua and
    Klamet valleys in Oregon, bordering on California, is about six
    hundred miles, making the distance from Nauvoo to the best portions
    of Oregon one thousand seven hundred miles.

    There is no government established there; and it is so near
    California that when a government shall be established there, it
    may readily embrace that country likewise. There is much barren
    country, rocks and mountains in Oregon; but the valleys are very
    fertile. I am persuaded that Congress will pass no act in relation
    to that country, from the fact that the resolution requesting
    the President to give notice to the British Government for the
    discontinuance of the treaty of joint {375} occupation of Oregon
    was voted down with a rush; and this notice must be given before
    any action can be had unless Congress violates the treaty; at least
    so say the politicians here.

    Judge Douglas has given me a map of Oregon, and also a report on an
    exploration of the country lying between the Missouri river and the
    Rocky Mountains on the line of the Kansas and great Platte rivers,
    by Lieut. J. C. Fremont, of the corps of Topographical Engineers.
    On receiving it I expressed a wish that Mr. Smith could see it.
    Judge Douglas says "It is a public document, and I will frank it
    to him." I accepted his offer, and the book will be forthcoming to
    you. The people are so eager for it here that they have even stolen
    it out of the library. The author is Mr. Benton's son-in-law. [3]
    Judge Douglas borrowed it of Mr. Benton. I was not to tell any one
    in this city where I got it. The book is a most valuable document
    to any one contemplating a journey to Oregon. The directions
    which I have given may not be exactly correct, but the book will
    tell correctly. Judge Douglas says he can direct Mr. Smith to
    several gentlemen in California who will be able to give him any
    information on the state of affairs in that country: and when he
    returns to Illinois, he will visit Mr. Smith.

    Brother Pratt and myself drafted a bill this morning, and handed
    it into the committee on the judiciary from the Senate, asking
    an appropriation of two million dollars for the relief of the
    sufferers among our people in Missouri in 1836-9, to be deposited
    in the hands of the City Council of Nauvoo, and by them dealt out
    to the sufferers in proportion to their loss. We intend to tease
    them until we either provoke them or get them to do something
    for us. I have learned this much--that if we want Congress to do
    anything for us in drawing up our memorial, we must not ask what
    is right in the matter, but we must ask what kind of a thing will
    Congress pass? Will it suit the politics of the majority? Will
    it be popular or unpopular? For you might as well drive a musket
    ball through a cotton bag, or the Gospel of Christ through the
    heart of a priest, case-hardened by sectarianism, bigotry and
    superstition, or a camel through the eye of a needle, as to drive
    anything through Congress that will operate against the popularity
    of politicians.

    I shall probably leave here in a few days, and Brother Pratt will
    remain. I go to get money to sustain ourselves with.

    I shall write again soon, and let you know what restrictions, if
    any, are laid upon our citizens in relation to passing through the
    Indian Territories. I shall communicate everything I think will
    benefit. In the meantime, if the council have any instructions to
    give us, we shall be happy to receive them here or at Philadelphia.

    John Ross is here; we intend to see him. It is uncertain when
    Congress {376} rises. It will be a long pull, in my opinion. As
    ever, I am, yours sincerely,

    ORSON HYDE.

    P.S.--Elder Pratt's best respects to the brethren.

Willard Richards was instructed to answer the above letters, and Elders
Lyman Wight and Heber C. Kimball were instructed to carry the answers.

Council adjourned at 6 p.m.

The steamer _Maid of Iowa_ returned from Rock River with four hundred
bushels of corn, and two hundred bushels of wheat, which had been
purchased for the Temple. At 8 p.m. I went on board with Dr. Willard
Richards, and visited Captain Dan Jones.

I insert a letter which I received from Henry Clay:

    _Letter: Henry Clay to the Prophet_.

    ASHLAND, November 15, 1843.

    DEAR SIR.--I have received your letter in behalf of the Church of
    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, stating that you understand that
    I am a candidate for the presidency, and inquiring what will be my
    rule of action relative to you as a people should I be elected.

    I am profoundly grateful for the numerous and strong expressions of
    the people in my behalf as a candidate for president of the United
    States; but I do not so consider myself. That must depend upon
    future events and upon my sense of duty.

    Should I be a candidate, I can enter into no engagements, make no
    promises, give no pledge to any particular portion of the people of
    the United States. If I ever enter into that high office I must go
    into it free and unfettered, with no guarantees but such as are to
    be drawn from my whole life, character and conduct.

    It is not inconsistent with this declaration to say that I have
    viewed with lively interest the progress of the Latter-day Saints;
    that I have sympathized in their sufferings under injustice, as it
    appeared to me, which have been inflicted upon them; and I think,
    in common with other religious communities, they ought to enjoy the
    security and protection of the Constitution and the laws.

    I am, with great respect, your friend and obedient servant,

    H. CLAY.

    To Joseph Smith, Esq.

    _The Prophet's Answer to Clay's Letter_.

    [Under the date of the Journal's entry here being followed, May
    13, {377} 1844, President Smith sent a reply to the above eminent
    statesman's letter, taking him severely to task for his evident
    desire to be non-committal with reference to the problem presented
    by the wrongs which had been inflicted upon the Latter-day Saints
    by Missouri. Vexed by remembrance of the cruelty and injustice
    endured by the Saints in Missouri and the general indifference
    to their suffering among public men, the letter was written in a
    caustic and, at times, vehement vein.]

I instructed Thomas Bullock to take charge of the books of the_ Maid of
Iowa_ and go on board as clerk.

_Tuesday, 14.--_Rode out about 7 a.m. The _Maid of Iowa_ started for
St. Louis at 8:30 a.m.

This afternoon, Mr. Reid, my old lawyer [4] gave a lecture on the
stand, relating the history of some of my first persecutions. I spoke
after he closed, and continued my history to the present time, relating
some of the doings of the apostates in Nauvoo.

At 4 p.m. prayer meeting; few present. Prayed for Elder Woodworth's
daughter, who was sick. Elder Lyman Wight was present.

_Wednesday, 15.--_At home; much rain through the day; river rising
rapidly. Mr. Adams, son of John Quincy Adams, with Dr. Goforth, called
to see me at the Mansion.

At 5 p.m. went to my office, and heard my letter to Mr. Clay read. At 7
p.m. rode to the upper landing with Mr. Adams.

I insert the following from the _Times and Seasons_:

    STATUS OF AFFAIRS AT NAUVOO.

    We take pleasure in announcing to the Saints abroad that Nauvoo
    continues to flourish, and the little one has become a thousand.
    Quite a number of splendid houses are being erected, and the Temple
    is rapidly progressing, insomuch that there is one universal
    expectation that before next winter closes in upon us the cap-stone
    will have been raised and the building enclosed.

    The Saints continue to flock together from all parts of the
    widespread continent and from the islands of the sea. Three ship's
    companies {378} have arrived this spring from England, and are now
    rejoicing in the truths of the everlasting Gospel.

    The Prophet is in good health and spirits, and unwearied in his
    anxiety and labors to instruct the Saints in the things of God and
    the mysteries of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Indeed we may truly
    say that those who come to scoff remain to pray.

    Many have come here filled with prejudice and strange
    anticipations, but have been convinced that report with her
    thousand tongues is false, and have almost invariably left a
    testimony behind them. Instead of finding Mr. Smith the cunning,
    crafty, and illiterate character that he had been represented
    to be, they have found in him the gentleman and scholar--open,
    generous, and brave.

    But it is his immediate connections and associates alone that can
    appreciate his virtues and his talents. While his face is set as
    a flint against iniquity from every quarter, the cries of the
    oppressed ever reach his heart, and his hand is ever ready to
    alleviate the sufferings of the needy.

    A few heartless villains can always be found who are watching for
    his downfall or death; but the Lord has generally caused them to
    fall into their own pit, and no weapon formed against him has
    prospered. One or two disaffected individuals have made an attempt
    to spread dissension; but it is like a tale that is nearly told,
    and will soon be forgotten.

    It was first represented as a monster calculated to spread
    desolation around; but we are credibly informed by a person who
    attended their first meeting, that there was much difficulty
    in raising a committee of seven, for there was some objection
    to Father--; but as none could be found to fill the vacuum, he
    constituted one of the seven _stars_!

    It will be unnecessary for us to say much about those luminaries
    of the last days, as they shine forth in their true colors in our
    columns this week in the trial of President Smith. But to say
    anything by way of warning to the brethren abroad would resemble
    the "ocean into tempest tossed, to waft a feather or drown a fly."
    "By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns
    or figs of thistles?"

    The glad tidings of salvation and the fullness of the Gospel are
    fast spreading from city to city and from nation to nation. The
    little stone will still increase till the knowledge of God covers
    the earth and righteousness and truth extend from pole to pole.

I copy from the _Neighbor_:

    WITHDRAWAL OF WILLIAM SMITH AS CANDIDATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

    _To the Friends and Voters of Hancock County:_ Elder William Smith
    (late representative) wishes to say to the friends and voters {379}
    of Hancock county, that in consequence of the sickness of his
    family, now in the hands of a doctor in the city of Philadelphia,
    he relinquishes the idea of offering himself as a candidate for a
    seat in the next Legislature of Illinois; but, as a matter of the
    highest consideration, would recommend his brother Hyrum Smith as a
    suitable and capable person to fill that office and worthy of the
    people's confidence and votes.

    We know of no person that would be more qualified to fill his
    station than General Hyrum Smith (his, William's, brother). We
    are not informed whether the General will accept of the office or
    not. If he will, we don't know of any gentleman in Hancock county
    who would be more competent. General Smith is a man of sterling
    integrity, deep penetration and brilliant talents. He is well
    versed in politics and as unchangeable as the everlasting hills. He
    is a man of probity and virtue, and an unwavering patriot.

    If General Hyrum Smith will allow his name to be brought forth, we
    go it for him; and we know from the confidence and respect that
    are entertained for him as a gentleman and a patriot, he will be
    elected. What say you, General?

_Thursday, 16.--_Went to my office at 8 a.m., and heard a letter
written by Elder Willard Richards, in behalf of the council to Elders
Orson Hyde and Orson Pratt at Washington.

I ordered the Municipal Court to meet at one p.m. and spent the morning
in reading.

    _Session of Municipal Court--Case of Jeremiah Smith_.

    At one p.m. I presided in Municipal Court. The case of Jeremiah
    Smith, Sen., who had been arrested by Jones on the charge of
    procuring money under false pretenses, came up on _habeas corpus_.
    The complainant, T. B. Johnson, by his counsel, Chauncey L. Higbee,
    asked for and obtained an adjournment for one week in order to
    procure witnesses. The petitioner by his counsel, George P. Stiles,
    objected to the plea, supposing the prosecuting party always ready
    for a trial. The court decided that it was an important case, and
    it was not best to be in haste; and if the prisoner is discharged
    on the merits of the case after a full investigation, he goes
    free forever. The majority of the court decided to adjourn until
    Thursday next.

I was about home the rest of the day and read in the {380} _Neighbor_
the report of the trial in the Municipal Court on the 8th inst.

The following appears in the _Times and Seasons_:

    LETTER: WILLIAM CLAYTON DESCRIBING THE FARCICAL PROCEEDINGS OF THE
    COURT AT DIXON IN THE CASE OF JOSEPH SMITH VS. JOSEPH H. REYNOLDS
    OF MISSOURI AND HARMON T. WILSON.

    DEAR SIR.--I have just returned from the north part of this state,
    where I have been on business for our beloved President Joseph
    Smith; and it feels so good to breathe the pure air of liberty and
    friendship after spending some three or four days in a swamp, or
    rather a slough of religious prejudice and political hypocrisy,
    which are equally nauseous and offensive, that I cannot let this
    opportunity pass without giving vent to some of my feelings in
    regard to what passed while I remained at Dixon, on Rock River.

    My principle business was to appear in the Lee county Circuit Court
    as a witness in the case of Joseph Smith, _vs_. Joseph H. Reynolds
    and Harmon T. Wilson, for false imprisonment and using unnecessary
    force and violence in arresting the plaintiff.

    A plea had been entered in this suit by this counsel for the
    defendants, to which the counsel for the plaintiff demurred. The
    demurrer was argued on Wednesday morning, the 8th inst., and the
    parties finally joined issue on the charge of using unnecessary
    force and violence; and the court gave permission, by consent of
    the bar, to proceed with the trial, but the counsel not being fully
    prepared, it was laid over until the following morning, the 9th
    inst.

    On Thursday morning, after the usual preliminaries of opening
    court, the above case was called up for trial, and the clerk
    ordered to impanel a jury; and here, sir, a scene took place which
    ought to make every honest American citizen blush and weep for the
    credit and honor of his country and laws. A number of men were
    called up, and when questioned as to whether they had previously
    expressed opinions in relation to the suit now pending, nearly
    the whole answered in the affirmative. The further question was
    then put as to whether they had any prejudice against either of
    the parties; to which a great majority replied they had against
    Smith. They were then questioned as to what their prejudice had
    reference--his religious sentiments, or general course of conduct.
    The greater part replied, to his religious sentiments; and the
    remainder said they were opposed to his general course of conduct.

    {381} About twenty men had to be called upon, one after another,
    out of the number the court finally selected twelve as competent
    jurors though the majority of these decidedly expressed their
    feelings of prejudice against the plaintiff. They were, however,
    accepted on the ground that they said they thought they could do
    justice to both parties, although some of them expressed a doubt
    whether they could do justice or not.

    The jury being sworn, the court, or rather the counsel, proceeded
    to examine the witnesses on the part of the plaintiff, which
    occupied nearly the whole day. But little of the real matter of
    fact could be set before the court on account of their being
    confined to the charge of unnecessary force and violence; but this
    was proven in the clearest point of light.

    I must refer to the testimony of old Mr. Dixon, whose silvery
    locks seem to tell an age of many years. His evidence related to
    the circumstance of the Missouri sheriff refusing for a length of
    time to give the plaintiff the privilege of_ habeas corpus_, and
    threatening to drag him to Missouri in fifteen minutes from the
    time they arrived at Dixon. The old gentleman seemed to tremble
    with indignation while relating the simple facts as they transpired
    at the time; and, like a true lover of his country, appeared proud
    of the privilege of telling those men that the citizens of Dixon
    would not suffer themselves to be disgraced by permitting them to
    drag away a citizen of this state to a foreign state for trial
    without the privilege of a trial by _habeas corpus_--a privilege
    which is guaranteed to every individual under like circumstances,
    and especially when it was understood that he was to be dragged
    to Missouri, amongst a people whose hands are yet dripping with
    the blood of murdered innocence, and who thirst for the blood of
    General Joseph Smith as the howling wolf thirsts for his prey.
    Surely such a picture would melt the heart of anything but an
    adamantine. There are those, and men too who profess to be the
    followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, who can hear such things and
    still wish the Missourians had got General Smith to Missouri to
    murder him without judge or jury, and surely they are no better
    than murderers themselves, and only lack the opportunity to make
    them shedders of innocent blood.

    After the evidence was through on the part of the plaintiff, the
    witness for the defense was examined, which only occupied a few
    minutes. The arguments were then advanced on both sides, during
    which time I could not help noticing how apt the respectable
    gentleman of the opposite counsel was to sing the song of "old Joe
    Smith," &c., which might appear very gentlemanly in his mind, but
    to me it seemed as contemptible as the voice of a stupid ass, or
    the tongue of slander.

    Finally the case was submitted to the jury, who were charged by the
    court, and then ordered to retire and bring in a sealed verdict the
    following {382} morning at nine o'clock. Friday morning came and
    with it the verdict, and it proved to be in favor of the plaintiff
    and against the defendants for forty dollars and costs of suit.
    I confess I was astonished when I heard it, and could not help
    thinking that prejudice sometimes overrules justice even in the
    jury box. I could not help comparing the results of this trial
    with one which came off the day previous, wherein a certain person
    complained of another for destroying his cow by setting his dogs
    on the animal until they worried her. It appeared the cow of the
    plaintiff had seen fit to break into the defendant's lot without
    asking leave, and the defendant, or rather his men, not liking such
    treatment, set the dogs on her and destroyed her. Well, the result
    of this trial was a verdict of damages for the plaintiff of thirty
    dollars and costs!

    Now, sir, compare the two cases. On the one hand here is a citizen
    of the United States near two hundred miles from his home and his
    friends; he is on a visit with his family, not dreaming of danger
    or difficulty. Two men--or rather wolves in sheep's clothing--for
    it is a fact that when Wilson and Reynolds made inquiry for General
    Smith at Dixon at the time of the arrest, they said they were
    "Mormon Elders," and wanted to see President Smith, &c.--two men, I
    say, while he is thus enjoying himself with his family, came upon
    him with each a loaded pistol in his hand, and threatened to shoot
    him dead if he offered the least resistance, although no resistance
    had been offered. They then began to haul him about; and when he
    asked them what they wanted with him, and what was their authority,
    they replied they were going to take him to Missouri; and jamming
    their pistols at his side, swore that was their authority. He
    requested them to let him go into the house to bid his family
    good-by; but this they positively refused, not even giving him the
    privilege to get his hat. They then forced him into the wagon and
    placing themselves one on each side, with a loaded pistol pressed
    close against his side, and repeatedly striking him with them,
    so as to make him lame and sore for two weeks afterwards, they
    drove him to Dixon, and ordered horses ready in fifteen minutes
    to drag him among his murderers, and otherwise abused, insulted,
    threatened, and treated him in the cruelest manner possible,
    filling his family with the most excruciating pangs, and rending
    the heart of his beloved companion with grief to witness their
    ferocious cruelty, not knowing but his life would be sacrificed
    before morning; and finally pursued their persecutions until it
    cost him from $3,500 to $5,000 expenses; and all this without a
    cause; and when he sues for justice against these men he obtains
    damages to the amount of forty dollars!

    On the other hand, a man loses a cow which had broke into his
    neighbor's lot, and he obtained damages to the amount of thirty
    dollars.

    {383} Now, sir, if this is not the effects of prejudice amounting
    to oppression, then I am no judge of right and wrong. I am very
    much inclined to think that if General Joseph Smith or any of his
    friends had treated any citizen of this state or any other state
    in the manner he was treated by these men, and they had sued for
    damages as he did, the case would have terminated very differently.
    However, so it is.

    The idea of a man yielding to such a degree of prejudice as to
    render him incapable of executing justice between man and man,
    merely from rumor and report, is to me perfectly ridiculous and
    contemptible, as well as wicked and unjust. And when a man is all
    the day long boasting of the rights and privileges guaranteed to
    every citizen of the United States under the Constitution and laws,
    and at the same time is so prejudiced against one of the most
    peaceable citizens that he does not know whether he can render
    him justice in a court of equity, but would rather strengthen the
    hands of mobocrats and law-breakers, the inference that one must
    naturally draw is that such a man is a consummate scoundrel and
    hypocrite, or that he is guilty of the most flagrant violation
    of the most sacred constitutional principles embraced in the
    fundamental doctrines of this republic. I am happy, sir, to have
    evidence daily that no such corrupt prejudice exists in the heart
    of General Joseph Smith, nor in the community, so far as I have
    been able to discover.

    Now, as to the exceptions these men have taken in regard to General
    Smith's religious views or general course of conduct, it matters
    not much. His religious views are his inalienable right, and are
    nobody's business; and the man who cannot render him justice on
    that account is a wilful violator of the laws he professes to
    admire; and, sir, I have for more than two years last past been
    a close observer of General Smith's general course of conduct,
    as well as his private life; and justice to him, to myself,
    and the community at large, compels me to say that, in all my
    intercourse with men, I never associated with a more honorable,
    upright, charitable, benevolent, and law-abiding man than is the
    much persecuted General Smith; and, sir, when I hear men speak
    reproachfully of him, I never ask for a second evidence of their
    corruptness and baseness. General Smith, sir, is a man of God, a
    man of truth, and a lover of his country; and never did I hear him
    breathe out curses or raillery at any man because he saw fit to
    differ in religious matters. Shame on the principle--shame on the
    man or set of men who show themselves so degraded and miserably
    corrupt.

    The last night of our stay at Dixon, I had the privilege of
    speaking on the principles of my religion to a number of
    individuals in a kind of argument with two men; and, sir, although
    it is near some four years since I have made a practice of
    preaching, it felt as sweet as ever. Truth to an honest heart is
    sweet, but to a wicked man is like a piercing {384} sword, as was
    manifest on that occasion; for although the principles of the
    Gospel were laid down so plain and clear that it was impossible to
    misunderstand, yet the opposing party repeatedly misconstrued my
    language, and even his own admission.

    I cannot persuade myself that the prejudice referred to above is a
    general thing. There are many honorable exceptions, and I presume
    if the Mormons had signified their intentions of supporting the
    Democratic candidate for the presidency at the ensuing election,
    instead of nominating an independent candidate of their own choice,
    their prejudice would not have been so great at the trial of
    Reynolds and Wilson, and perhaps General Smith would have obtained
    a judgment somewhat equivalent to the injuries he sustained from
    that unholy prosecution. But the Mormon people are too noble-minded
    to be bought or biased by fear or favor, and have been too often
    deceived by the plausible pretensions of demagogues to put trust in
    any but tried friends. General Smith has ever been an undeviating
    friend, not only to this community, but to the oppressed of every
    name or society, and we consider him as competent and qualified for
    the highest office of the United States as any other man, and a
    little more so; and a great deal more worthy of it.

    In conclusion, let me say that whatever others may say, I consider,
    it an honor to be associated with such a man as General Joseph
    Smith, and all true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and the
    more wicked men despise and misrepresent the principles and conduct
    of President Smith, the more I love him and delight in his society;
    and this I can do without prejudice or animosity against any man or
    set of men. I believe in the broad principle of equal rights and
    privileges, so far as religion or politics are concerned; and while
    I seek to enjoy my religion according to the knowledge in me, I
    will interfere with the rights of no man, nor persecute because my
    neighbor does not think as I do.

    A multitude of business compels me to close, and I must forbear. I
    have the honor to be your brother in the everlasting covenant.

From the _Neighbor_:--

    STEAMBOAT ELECTION.

    On the last upward voyage of the _Osprey_ from St. Louis to this
    place as usual, the merits of the several candidates for the next
    Presidential election were discussed. A vote was taken, and the
    following was the {385} state of the polls as handed to us by a
    gentleman who came as passenger:--

    General Joseph Smith, 26 gentlemen, 3 ladies.

    Henry Clay, 6 gentlemen, 2 ladies.

    Van Buren, 2 gentlemen, 0 ladies.

    The ladies are altogether forsaking Van Buren, and the gentlemen
    as a matter of course are following after. There is a wonderful
    shrinkage Henry Clay, but the General is going it with a rush.
    _Hurrah for the General_!

2. The reason for this reference to Missouri and of possible difficulty
arising from the Saints going to Oregon without a guarantee of
protection from the general government grew out of the fact that nearly
all the early settlers of the Oregon territory were from Missouri. Even
in this month of May, 1844, Cornelius Gilliam, the inveterate enemy
of the Saints, and who took so prominent a part in the troubles about
Far West, was collecting a large company at Independence, Missouri,
numbering over three hundred persons, to start for Oregon that season;
and all along the Oregon route on the south side of the Platte river,
the road was thronged during the next several years by emigrants, very
many of whom, and for some time the most of whom, were from Missouri_.

CHAPTER XVII.

THE STATE PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTION AT NAUVOO--THE STATES
REPRESENTED--SPEECH OF JOHN S. REID, ESQ.--EARLY DAYS WITH THE PROPHET.

_Friday, May 17, 1844.--_The State Convention met in the assembly room.
I copy the minutes.

    _State Convention at Nauvoo_.

    Convention met according to appointment, and was organized
    by appointing General Uriah Brown to the chair, and Dr. F.
    Merryweather secretary.

    Dr. G. W. Goforth presented the following letter, and took his
    seat in the convention. Several letters of the same character were
    presented by other gentlemen, but we have not room to insert them.

    MUSCOUTAH, ST. CLAIR COUNTY, ILL., May 4th, 1844.

    _Mr. G. W. Goforth_:

    Sir,--At various meetings held in this county, where I had the
    honor of attending, and the interesting topic of the selection of
    a suitable person for the high station of President of the United
    States being at this time the most important to Americans, and with
    the names that are now before the people, Joseph Smith of Nauvoo
    is recognized respectfully as a candidate, declarative in the
    principles of Jeffersonianism, or Jefferson democracy, free trade,
    and sailor's rights, and the protection of person and property.

    A convention being about to be held in the City of Nauvoo on the
    17th of this month (May), your name has been on every occasion
    given as a delegate to said convention, and through me the message
    to be imparted you, asking you to represent our expressions in the
    case.

    Please say for us, as Americans, that we will support General
    Joseph Smith in preference to any other man that has given, or
    suffered his name to come before us as a candidate. And at the
    great Baltimore Convention, to be held on the 13th of July, our
    delegation to said convention be authorized to proclaim for us
    submission to the nominee as may be by them brought before the
    people, in case of a failure to {387} nominate Joseph Smith (our
    choice), and unite approbatively for his support.

    Respectfully, sir, this communication and authority usward is
    forwarded you as your voucher at said convention, with our hearty
    prayers for the success of him whose special name is given in the
    important affairs.

    HENRY B. JACOBS.

    Agent for the friends of General Joseph Smith.

    Mr. Clay's letter to General Joseph Smith was then read by Mr.
    Phelps, and also General Joseph Smith's rejoinder, which was
    applauded by three cheers.

    It was moved and seconded that the following gentlemen be appointed
    a committee to draft resolutions for the adoption of this
    convention:--

    Dr. G. W. Goforth, John Taylor, Wm. W. Phelps, William Smith, and
    Lucian R. Foster.

    It was moved and seconded that he correspondence of the Central
    Committee for Government Reform of New York be read by W. W.
    Phelps, also General Joseph Smith's answer to the same.

    NEW YORK, April 20, 1844.

    _Joseph Smith, Esq_.,

    SIR,--The subscribers, the Central Committee of the National
    Reform Association, in accordance with a duty prescribed by their
    constitution, respectively solicit an expression of your views as
    a candidate for public office, on a subject that, as they think,
    vitally affects the rights and interests of their constituents.

    We see this singular condition of affairs, and while wealth in
    our country is rapidly accumulating, while internal improvements
    of every description are fast increasing, and while machinery has
    multiplied the power of production to an immense extent, yet with
    all these national advantages, the compensation for useful labor is
    getting less and less.

    We seek the cause of this anomaly, and we trace it to the monopoly
    of the land, which places labor at the mercy of capital. We
    therefore desire to abolish the monopoly, not by interfering with
    the conventional fights of persons now in possession of the land,
    but by arresting the further sale of all lands not yet appropriated
    as private property, and by allowing these lands hereafter to be
    freely occupied by those who may choose to settle on them.

    We propose that the public lands hereafter shall not be owned, but
    occupied only, the occupant having the right to sell or otherwise
    dispose of improvements to any one not in possession of other land;
    so that, by preventing any individual from becoming possessed of
    more than a limited quantity, every one may enjoy the right.

    This measure, we think, would gradually establish an equilibrium
    {388} between the agricultural and other useful occupations, that
    would ensure to all full employment and fair compensation for their
    labor, on the lands now held as private property, and to each
    individual on the public lands the right to work for himself on his
    own premises, or for another, at his option.

    An answer, as soon as convenient, will much oblige your
    fellow-citizens.

    John Windt, Egbert S. Manning, James Maxwell, Lewis Masquerier,
    Daniel Witter, Geore H. Evans, Ellis Smalley.

    NAUVOO, ILL., May 16th, 1844.

    _To John Windt, Egbert S. Manning, James Maxwell, Lewis Masquerier,
    Daniel Witter, George H. Evans, and Ellis Smalley, Esqrs_.

    GENTLEMEN:--

    Your communication of April 20th, soliciting my views relative
    to the public lands, is before me; and I answer, that as soon as
    the greater national evils could be remedied by the consolidated
    efforts of a virtuous people and the judicious legislation of wise
    men, so that slavery could not occupy one-half of the United States
    for speculation, competition, prodigality, and fleshy capital, and
    so that enormous salaries, stipends, fees, perquisites, patronage,
    and the wages of spiritual wickedness in ermine and lace could not
    swallow up forty or fifty millions of public revenue, I would use
    all honorable means to bring the wages of mechanics and farmers
    up, and salaries of public servants down, increase labor and money
    by a judicious tariff, and advise the people--who are only the
    sovereigns of the soil--to petition Congress to pass a uniform land
    law! that the air, the water, and the land, of the asylum of the
    oppressed, might be free to free men!

    With consideration of the highest regard for unadulterated freedom
    I have the honor to be your obedient servant.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    After which, the meeting adjourned for one hour.

    It was moved and seconded that the following gentlemen be
    constituted a committee to appoint electors for this State:--

    Dr. G. W. Goforth, L. Robinson, L. N. Scoville, Peter Hawes, and
    John S. Reid.

    It was moved and seconded that the following gentlemen be
    constituted a central committee of correspondence, having power to
    increase their number:--

    {389} Dr. Willard Richards, Dr. J. M. Bernhisel, W. W. Phelps, and
    Lucian R. Foster.

    The following delegates from the different states of the Union were
    then received by vote:--

    It was moved, seconded, and carried by acclamation, that General
    Joseph Smith, of Illinois, be the choice of this convention for
    President of the United States.

    It was moved, seconded, and carried by acclamation, that Sidney
    Rigdon, Esq., of Pennsylvania, be the choice of the Convention for
    Vice-President of the United States.

    The nine following resolutions were then adopted, the fifth of
    which was carried by acclamation.

    _Resolutions_.

    1._ Resolved,_ that from all the facts and appearances that are now
    {391} visible in the United States, we believe that much imbecility
    and fraud is practiced by the officers of Government; and that to
    remedy these evils it is highly necessary that a virtuous people
    should arise in the panoply of their might, and with one heart and
    one mind correct these abuses by electing wise and honorable men to
    fill the various offices of Government.

    2. _Resolved,_ that as union is power, the permanency and
    continuance of our political institutions depend upon the
    correction of the abuses.

    3. _Resolved,_ that as all political parties of the present day
    have degraded themselves by adhering more or less to corrupt
    principles and practices, by fomenting discord and division among
    the people, being swallowed in the vortex of party spirit and
    sectional prejudices, until they have become insensible to the
    welfare of the people and the general good of the country; and
    knowing that there are good men among all parties, in whose bosoms
    burn the fire of pure patriotism, we invite they, by the love of
    liberty, by the sacred honor of freemen, by the patriotism of
    the illustrious fathers of our freedom, by the glorious love of
    country, and by the holy principles of '76, to come over and help
    us to reform the Government.

    4. _Resolved,_ that to redress all wrongs, the government of the
    United States, with the President at its head, is as powerful in
    its sphere as Jehovah is in His.

    5. _Resolved,_ that the better to carry out the principles of
    liberty and equal rights, Jeffersonian democracy, free trade, and

    _Synopsis of the Remarks of Hon. John S. Reid_. [2]

    _Mr. Chairman_:

    I cannot leave this subject and do justice to my own feelings and
    the character of Gen. Smith, without giving a short history of the
    first persecution that came upon him in the counties of Chenango
    and Broome, in the State of New York, commenced by that class of
    people calling themselves Christians.

    The first acquaintance I had with Gen. Smith was about the year
    1833. He came into my neighborhood, being then about eighteen years
    of age, and resided there two years; during which time I became
    intimately acquainted with him. I do know that his character was
    irreproachable; that he was well known for truth and uprightness;
    that he moved in the first circles of the community, and he was
    often spoken of as a young man of intelligence and good morals,
    and possessing a mind susceptible of the highest intellectual
    attainments.

    I early discovered that his mind was constantly in search of truth,
    expressing an anxious desire to know the will of God concerning
    His children here below, often speaking of those things which
    professed Christians believe in. I have often observed to my best
    informed friends {393} (those that were free from superstition
    and bigotry) that I thought Joseph was predestinated by his God
    from all eternity to be an instrument in the hands of the great
    Dispenser of all good to do a great work. What it was I knew not.
    After living in that neighborhood about three years, enjoying the
    good feelings of his acquaintance as a worthy youth, he told his
    particular friends that he had had a revelation from God to go to
    the west about eighty miles to his father's, in which neighborhood
    he should find hid in the earth an old history written on golden
    plates, which would give great light and knowledge concerning
    the will of God towards His people in this generation, unfolding
    the destiny of all nations, kindreds and tongues. He said that
    he distinctly heard the voice of him that spake. Joseph Knight,
    one of the fathers of your Church, a worthy man, and my intimate
    friend, went with him. When I reflect upon our former friendship,
    Mr. Chairman, and upon the scenes that he had passed through in
    consequence of mal-administration, mobocracy and cruelty, I feel
    to lift up my voice to high heaven, and pray God to bless the aged
    veteran, and that his silver locks may go down to the grave in
    peace, like a shock of corn fully ripe. In a few days his friends
    [Joseph Smith's] returned with the glad news that Joseph had
    found the plates and had gone down to his father-in-law's for the
    purpose of translating them. I believe he remained there until he
    finished the translation. After the book was published, he came
    to live in the neighborhood of Father Knight's, about four miles
    from me, and began to preach the Gospel; and many were pricked in
    their hearts, believed, and were baptized in the name of the Lord
    Jesus. He soon formed a Church at Colesville; his meetings were
    numerously attended, and the eyes of all people were upon him with
    astonishment. Oh, Mr. Chairman, the world was turned upside down
    at once, and the devil,--always ready to assist and help along in
    all difficulties that arise among men--personified in some of the
    religionists, began to prick up his ears and jump, and kick and
    run about, like Jim Crow, calling for rotten eggs to help in the
    wake. You would have thought, sir, that Gog and Magog were let
    loose on the young man. He called upon the world's people (as they
    are called) but got no help; he then flew about in the sectarian
    churches, like lightning, and they immediately came to his aid,
    and uniting their efforts, roared against him like the thunders of
    Mount Sinai. When those fiery bigots were let loose, they united
    in pouring the red hot vials of their wrath upon his head. Their
    cry of "False Prophet! False Prophet!" was sounded from village to
    village, and every foul epithet that malice and wicked ingenuity
    could invent were heaped upon him. Yes, sir; the same spirit that
    influenced the Presbyterians of Massachusetts about one hundred and
    fifty years ago, in their persecution of the Quakers, when they
    first began to preach their doctrines in that state, was fully
    manifested by those religious bigots, {394} who were afraid if they
    let them alone, their own doctrines would come to naught. What was
    the result of the persecution in Massachusetts? Why, sir, warrants
    were made out by those churches having authority, and the Quakers
    were tried for heresy. But what was the result of those trials. The
    sentence of death was passed upon the Quakers for heresy by those
    religious fanatics, and three of them were hanged by the neck on
    Bloody Hill, in Boston, to make expiation for that unpardonable
    crime. "Tell it not in Gath," nor publish it not on the tops of
    the mountains in this boasted land of freedom, that the Puritans
    of New England, who had fled from the Old World in consequence
    of religious intolerance, that they might enjoy the sweets of
    liberty, so soon became persecutors themselves, and shed innocent
    blood, which still cries aloud from the dust for vengeance upon
    their heads. Let shame cover our faces when we mention the name of
    freedom in our grand republic.

    O my God! when in one portion of our country blood is flowing from
    the crime of worshiping our Creator according to the dictates of
    conscience, or as the Spirit directs, and in the other are great
    rejoicings in consequence thereof, where, I ask, is the boasted
    freedom for which our fathers fought and bled?

    O Thou who holdest the destinies of all things in Thine hands
    here below, return these blessings unto us, that we may keep
    them as precious jewels till time is no more. But, Mr. Chairman,
    I am wandering too far from the subject. I will return to the
    persecutions which followed General Smith, when his cheeks
    blossomed with the beauty of youth, and his eyes sparkled with
    innocence.

    These bigots soon made up a false accusation against him, and had
    him arraigned before Joseph Chamberlain, a justice of the peace, a
    man who was always ready to deal out justice to all, and a man of
    great discernment of mind.

    The case came up about 10 o'clock a.m. I was called upon to defend
    the prisoner, the prosecutors employed the best counsel they could
    get, and ransacked the town of Bainbridge and county of Chenango
    for witnesses that would swear hard enough to convict the prisoner;
    but they entirely failed. Yes, sir; let me say to you that not one
    blemish nor spot was found against his character. He came from that
    trial, notwithstanding the mighty efforts that were made to convict
    him of crime by his vigilant persecutors, with his character
    unstained by even the appearance of guilt.

    The trial closed about twelve o'clock at night. After a few
    moments' deliberation, the court pronounced the words, "Not
    guilty," and the prisoner was discharged. But, alas! the devil, not
    satisfied with his defeat, stirred up a man not unlike himself, who
    was more fit to dwell {395} among the fiends of hell than to belong
    to the human family, to go to Colesville and get another writ and
    take him to Broome county for another trial. They were sure they
    could send that boy to hell or to Texas, they did not care which;
    and in half an hour after he was discharged by the court, he was
    arrested again, and on the way to Colesville for another trial.

    I was again called upon by his friends to defend him against his
    malignant persecutors, and clear him from the false charges they
    had preferred against him. I made every reasonable excuse I could,
    as I was nearly worn down through fatigue and want of sleep, as I
    had been engaged in lawsuits for two days and nearly the whole of
    two nights. But I saw the persecution was great against him; and
    here let me say, Mr. Chairman, singular as it may seem, while Mr.
    Knight was pleading with me to go, a peculiar impression or thought
    struck my mind that I must go and defend him, for he was the Lord's
    anointed. I did not know what it meant, but thought I must go and
    clear the Lord's anointed. I said I would go, and started with as
    much faith as the Apostles had when they could remove mountains,
    accompanied by Father Knight, who was like the old patriarch that
    followed the ark of God to the city of David.

    We rode on till we came to the house of Hezekiah Peck, where a
    number of Mormon women were assembled, as I was informed, for the
    purpose of praying for the deliverance of the Prophet of the Lord.
    The women came out to our wagon, and Mrs. Smith among the rest.

    O my God, sir, what were my feeling when I saw that woman who
    had but a few days before given herself, heart and hand, to be
    a consort for life, and that so soon her crimson cheeks must be
    wet with tears that came streaming from her eyes! Yes, sir; it
    seemed that her very heart strings would be broken with grief. My
    feelings, sir, were moved with pity and sorrow for the afflicted,
    and on the other hand they were wrought up to the highest pitch of
    indignation against those fiends of hell who had thus caused the
    innocent to suffer.

    The next morning about ten o'clock, the court was organized. The
    prisoner was to be tried by three justices of the peace, that his
    departure out of the county might be made sure. Neither talents nor
    money were wanting to ensure them success. They employed the ablest
    lawyer in that county, and introduced twenty witnesses before dark,
    but proved nothing.

    They sent out runners and ransacked the hills and vales, grog-shops
    and ditches, gathered together a company that looked as if they
    had come from hell, and had been whipped by the soot-boy thereof,
    which they brought forward to testify one after another, but with
    no better success. Although they wrung and twisted into every
    shape, in trying {396} to tell something that would criminate the
    prisoner, nothing was proven against him whatever.

    Having got through with the examination of their witnesses about
    two o'clock in the morning, the case was argued about two hours.
    There was not one particle of testimony against the prisoner. No,
    sir; he came out like the three children from the fiery furnace,
    without the smell of fire upon his garments.

    The court deliberated upon the case for half an hour with closed
    doors, and then we were called in. The court arraigned the prisoner
    and said--"Mr. Smith, we have had your case under consideration,
    examined the testimony, and find nothing to condemn you; and
    therefore you are discharged."

    They then proceeded to reprimand him severely--not because anything
    derogatory to his character in any shape had been proven against
    him by the host of witnesses that had testified during the trial,
    but merely to please those fiends in human shape who were engaged
    in the unhallowed persecution of an innocent man, sheerly on
    account of his religious opinions.

    After they had got through, I arose and said--"This court puts
    me in mind of a certain trial held before Felix of old, when the
    enemies of Paul arraigned him before that venerable judge for some
    alleged crime, and nothing was found in him worthy of death or
    bonds. Yet, to please the Jews who were his accusers, he was left
    bound, contrary to law, and the court had served Mr. Smith in the
    same way, by their unlawful and uncalled for reprimand after his
    discharge to please his accusers."

    We got him away that night from the midst of three hundred people
    without his receiving any injury; but I am well aware that we were
    assisted by some higher power than man; for to look back on the
    scene, I cannot tell how we succeeded in getting him away. I take
    no glory to myself: it was the Lord's work, and marvelous in our
    eyes.

    This, Mr. Chairman, is a true history of the first persecution that
    came upon General Smith in his youth among professed Christians,
    and in a country heralded to the ends of the earth as a land of
    freedom, where all men have the constitutional right to worship as
    they please and believe what they please, without molestation, so
    long as they do not interfere with the rights and privileges of
    others--yes, sir; a persecution got up through the influence of
    religious bigotry by as vile a set of men as ever disgraced the
    family of man. But their devices against him were brought to naught
    by the Overruling Power that controls all things and brings to
    naught the counsels of the wicked.

    Mr. Chairman, little did I think that I was defending a boy that
    would rise to eminence like this man--a man whom God delights to
    honor as a {397} Prophet and leader of His people--one to whom He
    has given the keys of heaven and earth, and the power of David,
    and said to him, Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in
    heaven, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against you. And
    may he live to put his foot upon the neck of his enemies in love
    and meekness! I know, sir, that God has made him a leader of many
    thousands of people; and may he teach them in meekness and with
    that wisdom and judgment that God shall direct.

    I add no more.

    The Convention adjourned _sine die_

    F. MERRYWEATHER, Secretary.

I rode out in the afternoon.

About 6 p.m., a caucus was held; but, Emma being sick, I could not
attend. At night a large assemblage burned a barrel of tar in the
street. I went out to see what was the matter, and found they were
giving toasts; and as soon as they became aware of my presence; they
carried me on their shoulders twice round the fire, and escorted me to
the Mansion by a band of music.

Elders Franklin D. Richards and Joseph A. Stratton were ordained High
Priests and set apart to go on a mission to England by Elders Brigham
Young and Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards.

CHAPTER XVIII.

CHARGES AGAINST PRESIDENT SMITH BEFORE THE CIRCUIT COURT--HIS VOLUNTARY
APPEARANCES AT COURT--TREATMENT--RETURN TO NAUVOO.

_Saturday, May 18, 1844.--_At 9 a.m., I went with Heber C. Kimball
to visit President Brigham Young, and afterwards went out to the
regimental training, and also in the afternoon riding on my horse, "Joe
Duncan."

At 5 p.m., two cannons were fired opposite my old house, and the
regiments were dismissed.

The high Council cut off from the Church James Blakesley, Francis M.
Higbee, Charles Ivins, and Austin Cowles, for apostasy.

_Sunday, 19.--_Cloudy morning; rain about noon. I remained at home.
Elder Lyman Wight preached at the stand in the morning. The usual
prayer meeting at 2 p.m. was dispensed with on account of the mud and
rain.

In the evening I talked to the brethren at my house, Esquire Reid, my
old lawyer, being present, W. W. Phelps read my last letter to Henry
Clay to the company.

_Monday, 20.--_Emma continued very sick, and I was with her most of the
time.

At 10 a.m., there was a meeting at the stand for the purpose of
collecting means to enable Elder Lyman Wight to go to Washington.

[Sidenote: Court Session at Carthage.]

The Circuit Court commenced its sitting at Carthage, Judge Thomas
presiding. Brother Phelps and many of the brethren went to Carthage.
Phelps returned in the evening with the intelligence that {399} a
summons was supposed to be issued for me to appear on the same case
on which I was set free by_ habeas corpus_ on the 8th inst. [1] The
lawyers agreed to move an abatement. A good influence in favor of the
Saints appears to have prevailed.

A general court-martial of the Legion was held, Brevet Major General
Hyrum Smith presiding. It was adjourned to the 10th of June next.

_Tuesday, 21.--_A very pleasant morning. I rode out on horseback to the
prairie, with Porter Rockwell and Mr. Reid. At 7 a.m., Elders Brigham
Young, Heber C. Kimball, Lyman Wight, and about a hundred Elders, left
this city on the steamer _Osprey_ (Captain Anderson) for St. Louis.

The_ Maid of Iowa_ arrived at 8 a.m., with sixty-two Saints from the
Eastern States on board, all in good health and spirits. The clerk,
Thomas Bullock, reported the fields on each side of the river covered
with water to the depth of upwards of sixteen feet, and all the farms
on the flats of the Mississippi river were submerged, and the river was
still rising eight inches per day. The _Maid of Iowa_ started up the
river for Wapello on the Iowa river at 3 p.m.

I was at home towards night with Emma, who is somewhat better. I
shoveled dirt out of the ditch, while Wasson stood on the corner of the
fence to watch. An officer arrived having a summons and an attachment
to take me to Carthage, but he could not find me. I rode out in the
evening to see David Yearsley's child, who was sick, and returned home
at 9 p.m.

I copy from the _Times and Seasons_:--

    LETTER: GEORGE A. SMITH TO "TIMES AND SEASONS"--CONFERENCE AT
    NEWARK, ILLINOIS.

    "NEWARK, KENDALL COUNTY, ILL., May 21, 1844.

    _Editor of the Times and Seasons_:--

    DEAR SIR,--We arrived at Ottawa on the 17th inst., after driving
    {400} four days through the constant rains, and over roads almost
    impassable for man or beast. We were soon informed that the
    conference was removed twenty miles up Fox River, at the Newark
    Branch.

    Notice had been given for a political address to be delivered
    in the Court House in the evening by one of the Twelve; several
    hundred citizens assembled, and were addressed by Elder G. A.
    Smith. The speaker considered General Smith the smartest man in
    the United States, and best calculated to fill the presidential
    chair, which was applauded by the assembly. His political views as
    presented on that occasion seemed to please most of the people. At
    the close of the speech the congregation quietly dispersed. Elder
    Woodruff continued his journey ten miles, and held a meeting with
    the LaSalle Branch of 46 members, mostly emigrants from Norway.
    On the 18th we arrived at Newark, and attended the Conference
    according to appointment.

    The following is a copy of the minutes, which we forward for
    publication:--

    NEWARK, KENDALL COUNTY, ILL., May 18, 1844.

    Conference convened pursuant to notice.

    There were present two of the quorum of the Twelve, one High
    Priest, two Seventies, nine Elders, one Priest, and one Teacher.

    Conference called to order by Elder Woodruff.

    Elder George A. Smith called to the chair.

    Conference opened by singing, and prayer by the president.

    Representation of the several branches was called for, when the
    following branches were represented as follows:

    Newark Branch, 35 members, 1 Elder, 1 Teacher; Lasalle Branch, 46
    members, 2 Elders: Ottawa Branch, 16 members, 2 Elders; Bureau
    Branch, 15 members, 3 Elders; Pleasant Grove, McHenry County, 19
    members, 2 Elders; Indian Creek Branch, 5 members; Big Vermillion
    Branch, 4 members; French Creek Grove Branch, 2 members. Total 133
    members, 10 Elders, and 1 Teacher,

    Canute Petersen, Severt Olson, Zimri H. Baxter, Levi Lightfoot, S.
    D. Huffaker, Mades Madison, Vance Jacobs, and Oder Jacobson, were
    ordained Priests; Ole Johnson and Peter Maclin ordained Teachers,
    under the hands of Elders Wilford Woodruff, Geo. A. Smith, and Ezra
    Thayer.

    Appropriate remarks were then made by Elders Woodruff and Smith
    by way of counsel and instruction to those who had been ordained;
    followed by Elder David Savage.

    Adjourned until Sunday morning, 10 o'clock.

    Sunday, 19th.

    Met according to adjournment.

    Opened by singing and prayer by Elder a.m. Wilsey.

    {401} A discourse was then delivered by Elder Wilford Woodruff, in
    which he instructed the Elders to be careful to preach the first
    principles of the Gospel and doctrines of Christ, and not to spend
    their time in warring with the opinions of other men; showed the
    importance of revelation, and the necessity of a Prophet of God,
    as the head of the Church on earth, being as necessary in order to
    exist and advance in knowledge as for a natural body to possess a
    head in order to live. He considered we were enjoying the society
    of as good a Prophet in this day as any people ever enjoyed in any
    age of the world, and believed all good men would think so, if they
    were fully acquainted with him and his principles.

    He was followed by Elder Geo. A. Smith, who bore testimony to the
    truth of the fullness of the Gospel, counseled the Elders to be
    humble, and not get head and shoulders above their brethren, lest
    they fall, like the tallest trees of the forest, that are first
    swept down by the raging storm.

    Two o'clock, met according to adjournment, when the sacrament
    was administered, and many testimonies given from the Elders and
    members present concerning the truth of the work they had received.

    Conference was dismissed amid the best of feelings, which
    were manifested not only by all the Saints, but by the whole
    congregation of citizens that attended. Good order prevailed
    through the whole conference. Attention, kindness, and civility,
    were manifested by all.

    GEO. A. SMITH, President.

    ASA MANCHESTER, Clerk.

    At the close of the Conference, Elders C. C. Rich, David Fullmer,
    Norton Jacobs, and Moses Smith arrived direct from Nauvoo, on their
    way to Michigan.

    20th--We have appointed a political meeting in Newark, this
    evening, and one at Joliet tomorrow evening, where we expect to
    present to the citizens General Smith's Views of the Powers and
    Policy of the Government, and discuss the subject of politics.

    WILFORD WOODRUFF.

    GEO. A. SMITH.

_Wednesday, 22.--_At home, watching, as the officers from Carthage were
after me.

[Sidenote: Visit of Sac and Fox Indians to Nauvoo.]

At 10 a.m., about 40 Indians of the Sacs and Foxes came up in front of
the Mansion, four or five of them being mounted, among whom was Black
Hawk's brother, Kis-kish-kee, &c. I was obliged to send word I could
not see them at present. They encamped in the Council Chamber afternoon
{402} and night. I was with the police on duty, and saw several
individuals lurking around.

Very pleasant day.

President Brigham Young preached to the brethren in St. Louis this
evening.

_Thursday, 23.--_Emma rather better. Read Hebrew with Neibaur, and
counseled with various friends.

At 10 a.m., the Municipal Court met, Newel K. Whitney presiding; but
there not being a quorum present, adjourned for one week.

[Sidenote: Address of the Prophet to the Indians.]

At one p.m., had a talk with the Sac and Fox Indians in my back
kitchen. They said--"When our fathers first came here, this land was
inhabited by the Spanish; when the Spaniards were driven off, the
French came, and then the English and Americans; and our fathers talked
a great deal with the Big Spirit." They complained that they had been
robbed of their lands by the whites, and cruelly treated.

I told them I knew they had been wronged, but that we had bought this
land and paid our money for it. I advised them not to sell any more
land, but to cultivate peace with the different tribes and with all
men, as the Great Spirit wanted them to be united and to live in peace.
"The Great Spirit has enabled me to find a book [showing them the Book
of Mormon], which told me about your fathers, and Great Spirit told me,
'You must send to all the tribes that you can, and tell them to live in
peace;' and when any of our people come to see you, I want you to treat
them as we treat you."

At 3 p.m., the Indians commenced a war dance in front of my old house.
Our people commenced with music and firing cannon. After the dance,
which lasted about two hours, the firing of cannon closed the exercise,
and with our music marched back to the office. Before they commenced
dancing, the Saints took up a collection to get the Indians food.

{403} A. A. Lathrop came to my clerk, Dr. Richards, and told him an
officer was on his way with an attachment for him, and that the grand
jury had found a bill against me for adultery, on the testimony of
William Law; he had come from Carthage in two hours and thirty minutes
to bring the news. Dr. Richards came to my house and stayed all night.

Aaron Johnson came from Carthage, and said that Foster had been
swearing that I swore to the complaint on which Simpson was arrested. I
instructed Johnson and Rockwell to go to Carthage in the morning, and
have him indicted for perjury, as I never did swear to the complaint.
The officer was after John D. Parker also, and report says Brigham
Young, Heber C. Kimball and W. Clayton.

Past nine p.m., I walked a little way with Dr. Richards for exercise.

[Sidenote: Hyrum's Caution to the Prophet on the Freedom of Speaking.]

My brother Hyrum called in the evening, and cautioned me against
speaking so freely about my enemies, &c., in such a manner as to make
it actionable. I told him that six months would not roll over his head
before they would swear twelve as palpable lies about him as they had
about me.

President Brigham Young left St. Louis at noon in the steamboat _Louis
Philippe_.

_Friday, 24.--_With my family all day.

Aaron Johnson and Orrin P. Rockwell went to Carthage to get Robert D.
Foster indicted; but they returned again as the grand jury had risen.
Joseph H. Jackson was at Carthage, and had sworn falsely against me.

At 6 p.m., went to Dr. Bernhisel's room, and had counsel with Brothers
Richards and Phelps. I ordered a meeting of the City Council for
tomorrow, and returned to my family after being absent about one hour.

The Central Committee wrote a letter to Hugh Clark Esq.:--

    {404} _Letter: Central Campaign Committee to Hugh Clark,
    Esq.,--Presidential Election Matters_.

    NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, May 24, 1844.

    SIR.--Having received your address through our mutual friend, Mr.
    Edward Doughty, we forward with this per next mail the Nauvoo
    _Neighbor_ of the 22nd inst., through which you will learn the
    doings of a State Convention held in this place on the 17th; and
    this communication has been drawn forth, in a great degree, through
    our sympathies for a people who are now being mobbed in the city
    of brotherly love (Philadelphia) as we have been for many years
    in Missouri; and for what? For our religion, although called by
    another name.

    The Mormons and the Catholics are the most obnoxious to the
    sectarian world of any people, and are the only two who have not
    persecuted each other and others in these the United States, and
    the only two who have suffered from the cruel hand of mobocracy
    for their religion under the name of foreigners; and to stay this
    growing evil, and establish Jeffersonian democracy, free trade
    and sailor's rights, and protection of person and property, we
    have nominated General Joseph Smith for the next president of
    the nation--a man with whom we are thoroughly acquainted, and
    have no fear in pledging our lives, our fortunes and our sacred
    honor, that, if elected, he will give and secure these inestimable
    blessings to every individual and society of men, no matter what
    their religious faith. Help us to elect this man, and we will help
    you to secure these privileges which belong to you, and break every
    yoke.

    You will please to consider yourself a member of the corresponding
    committee with us, agreeable to the resolution of the State
    Convention, and lay this subject before your people, giving us your
    views on receipt hereof, and open such correspondence as wisdom
    shall dictate.

    General Smith's prospects are brightening every day. With
    sentiments of the highest consideration, we are your obedient
    servants,

    WILLARD RICHARDS,

    JOHN M. BERNHISEL,

    W. W. PHELPS,

    LUCIAN R. FOSTER,

    Central Committee of Correspondence for the Election of General
    Joseph Smith to the Presidency.

    HUGH CLARK, ESQ. Alderman.

    Corner of Fourth and Masters Street, Northern Liberties,
    Philadelphia.

Rainy evening.

A conference was held at Chicago, Alfred Cordon, president, and James
Burgess, clerk. Eleven Elders were {405} present, and a very favorable
impression was made upon the minds of the people.

[Sidenote: Reported Indictments of the Prophet.]

_Saturday, 25.--_At home, keeping out of the way of the expected writs
from Carthage. Towards evening, Edward Hunter and William Marks, of
the grand jury returned from Carthage; also Marshal John P. Greene and
Almon W. Babbitt, who informed me there were two indictments found
against me, one charging me with false swearing on the testimony of
Joseph H. Jackson and Robert D. Foster, and one charging me with
polygamy, or something else, on the testimony of William Law, that I
had told him so! The particulars of which I shall learn hereafter.
There was much false swearing before the grand jury. Francis M.
Higbee swore so hard that I had received stolen property, &c., that
his testimony was rejected. I heard that Joseph H. Jackson had come
into the city. I therefore instructed the officers to arrest him for
threatening to take life, &c.

I had a long talk with Edward Hunter, my brother Hyrum, Dr. Richards,
William Marks, Almon W. Babbitt, Shadrach Roundy, Edward Romney and
others, and concluded not to keep out of the way of the officers any
longer.

At 2 p.m. I was in council in my north room, and heard the letters from
Elder O. Hyde read, and instructed Dr. Richards to write an answer,
which he did as follows:

    _Letter:--Willard Richards to Orson Hyde--Answering Hyde's Letter
    on Western Movement_.

    NAUVOO, May 26, 1844.

    _Orson Hyde, Esq_.:

    SIR.--Yours of April 30th is received. The council convened this
    afternoon, and, after investigation, directed an answer, which must
    be brief to correspond with the press of business.

    All the items you refer to had previously received the deliberation
    of the council.

    {406} Messrs. Lyman Wight and Heber C. Kimball will doubtless be in
    Washington before you receive this, from whom you will learn all
    things relative to Texas, &c. Our great success at present depends
    upon our faith in the doctrine of election; and our faith must be
    made manifest by our works and every honorable exertion made to
    elect Gen. Smith.

    Agricultural pursuits will take care of themselves, regulating
    their own operations and the rich also; but the poor we must gather
    and take care of, for they are to inherit the kingdom.

    Nauvoo will be a "corner stake of Zion" forever, we most assuredly
    expect. Here are the house and the ordinance, extend where else we
    may.

    Press the bills through the two houses, if possible. If Congress
    will not pass them, let them do as they have a mind with them. If
    they will not pass our bills, but will give us "something," they
    will give what they please, and it will be at our option to accept
    or reject.

    Men who are afraid of "hazarding their influence" in the councilor
    political arena are good for nothing. 'Tis the fearless, undaunted
    and persevering who will gain the conquest of the forum.

    Sidney Rigdon, Esq., is about to resign the postoffice at Nauvoo,
    in favor of Gen. Joseph Smith, the founder of the city. He has the
    oldest petitions now on file in the general postoffice for that
    station, and has an undoubted claim over every other petitioner, by
    being the founder and supporter of the city, and by the voice of
    nineteen-twentieths of the people; and every sacred consideration;
    and it is the wish of the council that you engage the Illinois
    delegation to use their influence to secure the office to General
    Smith without fail, and have them ready to act on the arrival of
    Mr. Rigdon's resignation, and before too, if expedient.

    We are also writing to Justin Butterfield, Esq., U. S. Attorney
    for the district of Illinois, who has kindly offered his services
    to secure the post office to the General, he having been here and
    seen for himself the situation; and probably his letter to the
    department will arrive nearly as soon as this.

    The election on the principle of Jeffersonian democracy, free
    trade, and protection of person and property, is gaining ground in
    every quarter. All is well in Nauvoo, although some of the Anties
    are trying to do us injury; but their efforts are palsied, and they
    make very little headway. You remember the Preston motto, "Truth
    will prevail!" [2] Therefore we go ahead.

    {407} You have the best wishes of the council and friends here. I
    am, sir, most respectfully yours,

    W. RICHARDS, Recorder.

    By order of the council.

    N. B. Your families and friends were well last information.

Sidney Rigdon resigned the office of postmaster of Nauvoo, and
recommended me as his successor.

The _Maid of Iowa_ arrived at five p.m.

The High Council have directed the following testimony to be published
in the _Neighbor_, I copy it with the editor's remarks, to show the
character of the men who are now seeking to destroy my life and
usefulness, and overthrow the work of the Lord which He has commenced
through my instrumentality:

    [Here follow the affidavits of Margaret J. Nyman, Matilda J. Nyman,
    Sarah Miller, and an extract from the testimony of Catherine Warren
    before the High Council of the Church to the effect that Chauncey
    L. Higbee had brought about their ruin by deceit in representing
    that Joseph Smith taught that promiscuous sexual relations were not
    sinful when kept secret, and by this misrepresentation he, the said
    Chauncey L. Higbee, accomplished his wicked purposes].

    _Editorial Comment_.

    We have abundance of like testimony on hand which may be
    forthcoming if we are compelled; at present the foregoing may
    suffice.

    "Why have you not published this before?" We answer--on account of
    the humility and entreaties of Higbee at the time; and on account
    of the feelings of his parents, who are highly respectable, we
    have forborne until now. The character of Chauncey L. Higbee is so
    infamous, and his exertions such as to destroy every principle of
    righteousness, that forbearance is no longer a virtue.

    After all that this Chauncey L. Higbee has done in wickedly and
    maliciously using the name of Joseph Smith to persuade innocent
    females to submit to gratify his hellish lusts, and then blast the
    character of the most chaste, pure, virtuous and philanthropic man
    on earth, he, to screen himself from the law of the land and the
    just indignation of an insulted people, and save himself from the
    penitentiary, or whatever punishment his unparalleled crimes merit,
    has entered into a conspiracy with the Laws and others against
    the lives of those who are knowing to his abandoned conduct, thus
    hoping to save himself from the disgrace which must follow an
    exposure, and wreak his vengeance and gratify his revenge for his
    awful disappointment.

[Sidenote: Conference in Jefferson Co., N.Y.]

{408} A two days' conference was held in Jefferson county, New York,
at 10 a.m. Present 300 Saints, 150 of whom had embraced the Gospel
since last autumn. Nine branches were represented, containing 289
members, 16 Elders, 8 Priests and 1 Teacher. An immense concourse of
people assembled to hear the Elders preach. Elder Benjamin Brown was
President, and J. W. Crosby, Clerk.

[Sidenote: Conference, Dresden, Tenn.]

A three days' conference was held at Dresden, Weakly county, Tennessee.
Elder A. O. Smoot was chosen president, and D. P. Raney, secretary. A
large congregation assembled, but the proceedings were interrupted by
a mob headed by some of the leading men of the county; yet a candidate
for elector was appointed by my friends.

_Sunday, 26.--_At 10 a.m. I preached at the Stand. The following
synopsis was reported by Mr. Thos. Bullock, clerk of the steamer, _Maid
of Iowa_.

    _Address of the Prophet--His Testimony Against the Dissenters at
    Nauvoo_.

    President Joseph Smith read the 11th Chap. II Corinthians. My
    object is to let you know that I am right here on the spot where
    I intend to stay. I, like Paul, have been in perils, and oftener
    than anyone in this generation. As Paul boasted, I have suffered
    more than Paul did. I should be like a fish out of water, if I were
    out of persecutions. Perhaps my brethren think it requires all
    this to keep me humble. The Lord has constituted me so curiously
    that I glory in persecution. I am not nearly so humble as if I
    were not persecuted. If oppression will make a wise man mad, much
    more a fool. If they want a beardless boy to whip all the world, I
    will get on the top of a mountain and crow like a rooster: I shall
    always beat them. When facts are proved, truth and innocence will
    prevail at last. My enemies are no philosophers: they think that
    when they have my spoke under, they will keep me down; but for the
    fools, I will hold on and fly over them.

    God is in the still small voice. In all these affidavits,
    indictments, it is all of the devil--all corruption. Come on! ye
    prosecutors! ye false swearers! All hell, boil over! Ye burning
    mountains, roll down your lava! for I will come out on the top at
    last. I have more to boast of than ever any man had. I am the only
    man that has ever been able to keep a whole church together since
    the days {409} of Adam. A large majority of the whole have stood
    by me. Neither Paul, John, Peter, nor Jesus ever did it. I boast
    that no man ever did such a work as I. The followers of Jesus ran
    away from Him; but the Latter-day Saints never ran away from me
    yet. You know my daily walk and conversation. I am in the bosom of
    a virtuous and good people. How I do love to hear the wolves howl!
    When they can get rid of me, the devil will also go. For the last
    three years I have a record of all my acts and proceedings, for I
    have kept several good, faithful, and efficient clerks in constant
    employ: they have accompanied me everywhere, and carefully kept my
    history, and they have written down what I have done, where I have
    been, and what I have said; therefore my enemies cannot charge me
    with any day, time, or place, but what I have written testimony
    to prove my actions; and my enemies cannot prove anything against
    me. They have got wonderful things in the land of Ham. I think the
    grand jury have strained at a gnat and swallowed the camel.

    A man named Simpson says I made an affidavit against him, &c. Mr.
    Simpson says I arrested him. I never arrested Mr. Simpson in my
    life. He says I made an affidavit against him. I never made an
    affidavit against him in my life. I will prove it in court. I will
    tell you how it was: Last winter I got ready with my children to
    go to the farm to kill hogs. Orrin P. Rockwell was going to drive.
    An Englishman came in and wanted a private conversation with me. I
    told him I did not want any private conversations. "I demand one
    of you!" Such a one I am bound to obey anyhow. Said he--"I want
    a warrant against the man who stabbed Brother Badham." He said it
    was a man who boarded at Davis'. He said it was Mr. Simpson--it
    answered his description. I said I had no jurisdiction out of the
    city. He said--"The man must be arrested, or else he will go away."
    I told him--"You must go to Squire Wells, Johnson, or Foster." Mr.
    Lytle stepped up and said--"I am a policeman." I jumped into my
    carriage, and away I went.

    When I came back I met Mr. Jackson. He said--"You did wrong in
    arresting Mr. Simpson." I told him I did not do it. I went over
    and sat down, and related the circumstances. He turned round and
    said--"Mr. Smith, I have nothing against you; I am satisfied." He
    went and supped with me. He declared in the presence of witnesses,
    that he had nothing against me. I then said--"I will go over to
    Esquire Johnson, and testify what the Englishman told me." I told
    him not to make out that I believe he is the man, but that I
    believe he is innocent. I don't want to swear that he is the man.
    Messrs. Coolidge, Rockwell, Hatfield, and Hawes were present.

    Mr. Johnson made one [a complaint] out in due form: and as I sat
    down in a bustle the same as I do when one of the clerks brings a
    deed for {410} me to sign. Johnson read it. I said--"I can't swear
    to that affidavit; I don't believe it; tear up that paper." Mr.
    Simpson agreed to come before Badham and make it up. I did not
    swear to it [_i. e._ to the complaint.]

    After a while, Dr. Foster and others came in. They called me up
    to testify. I told it all the same as I do here. Mr. Simpson rose
    up, and asked--"Do you believe now that I am the man who stabbed
    Mr. Badham?" I replied--"No sir, I do not now, nor ever did: the
    magistrate says I did not swear to it." He considered, and made a
    public declaration that he was satisfied with me.

    Aaron Johnson went before the grand jury and swore I did not swear
    to it, when Dr. Foster goes and swears that I swore to it, and that
    he was in the room when he was not in. Chauncey wanted me to stay
    and have a conversation. Dr. Foster asked Aaron Johnson for the
    writ and affidavit. He handed them to Dr. Foster, who read them,
    and then threw them into the fire. I said--"Doctor, you ought not
    to have burned it; it was my paper." Dr. Foster goes to the grand
    jury and swears he did not burn only one; but I say he burnt both.
    This is a fair sample of the swearing that is going on against me.

    The last discharge was the 40th; now the 41st, 42nd, 43rd; all
    through falsehood. Matters of fact are as profitable as the Gospel,
    and which I can prove. You will then know who are liars, and who
    speak the truth I want to retain your friendship on holy grounds.

    Another indictment has been got up against me. It appears a holy
    prophet has arisen up, and he has testified against me; the reason
    is, he is so holy. The Lord knows I do not care how many churches
    are in the world. As many as believe me, may. If the doctrine that
    I preach is true, the tree must be good. I have prophesied things
    that have come to pass, and can still.

    Inasmuch as there is a new church, this must be old, and of course
    we ought to be set down as orthodox. From henceforth let all the
    churches now no longer persecute orthodoxy. I never built upon any
    other man's ground. I never told the old Catholic that he was a
    fallen true prophet God knows, then, that the charges against me
    are false.

    I had not been married scarcely five minutes, and made one
    proclamation of the Gospel, before it was reported that I had seven
    wives. I mean to live and proclaim the truth as long as I can.

    This new holy prophet [William Law] has gone to Carthage and swore
    that I had told him that I was guilty of adultery. This spiritual
    wifeism! Why, a man dares not speak or wink, for fear of being
    accused of this.

    William Law testified before forty policemen, and the assembly
    room full of witnesses, that he testified under oath that he never
    had heard or seen or knew anything immoral or criminal against me.
    He testified {411} under oath that he was my friend, and not the
    "Brutus." There was a cogitation who was the "Brutus." I had not
    prophesied against William Law. He swore under oath that he was
    satisfied that he was ready to lay down his life for me, and he
    swears that I have committed adultery.

    I wish the grand jury would tell me who they are--whether it will
    be a curse or blessing to me. I am quite tired of the fools asking
    me.

    A man asked me whether the commandment was given that a man may
    have seven wives; and now the new prophet has charged me with
    adultery. I never had any fuss with these men until that Female
    Relief Society brought out the paper against adulterers and
    adulteresses.

    Dr. Goforth was invited into the Laws' clique, and Dr. Foster and
    the clique were dissatisfied with that document, and they rush
    away and leave the Church, and conspire to take away my life; and
    because I will not countenance such wickedness, they proclaim that
    I have been a true prophet, but that I am now a fallen prophet.

    Jackson has committed murder, robbery, and perjury; and I can prove
    it by half-a-dozen witnesses. Jackson got up and said--"By God, he
    is innocent," and now swears that I am guilty. He threatened my
    life.

    There is another Law, not the prophet, who was cashiered for
    dishonesty and robbing the government. Wilson Law also swears that
    I told him I was guilty of adultery. Brother Jonathan Dunham can
    swear to the contrary. I have been chained. I have rattled chains
    before in a dungeon for the truth's sake. I am innocent of all
    these charges, and you can bear witness of my innocence, for you
    know me yourselves.

    When I love the poor, I ask no favors of the rich. I can go to
    the cross--I can lay down my life; but don't forsake me. I want
    the friendship of my brethren.--Let us teach the things of Jesus
    Christ. Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before
    a downfall.

    Be meek and lowly, upright and pure; render good for evil. If you
    bring on yourselves your own destruction, I will complain. It is
    not right for a man to bare down his neck to the oppressor always.
    Be humble and patient in all circumstances of life; we shall then
    triumph more gloriously. What a thing it is for a man to be accused
    of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only
    find one.

    I am the same man, and as innocent as I was fourteen years ago;
    and I can prove them all perjurers. I labored with these apostates
    myself until I was out of all manner of patience; and then I sent
    my brother Hyrum, whom they virtually kicked out of doors.

    I then sent Mr. Backenstos, when they declared that they were my
    enemies. I told Mr. Backenstos that he might tell the Laws, if they
    had any cause against me I would go before the Church, and confess
    it {412} to the world. He [Wm. Law] was summoned time and again,
    but refused to come. Dr. Bernhisel and Elder Rigdon know that I
    speak the truth. I cite you to Captain Dunham, Esquires Johnson and
    Wells, Brother Hatfield and others, for the truth of what I have
    said. I have said this to let my friends know that I am right.

    As I grow older, my heart grows tenderer for you. I am at all
    times willing to give up everything that is wrong, for I wish this
    people to have a virtuous leader, I have set your minds at liberty
    by letting you know the things of Christ Jesus. When I shrink not
    from your defense will you throw me away for a new man who slanders
    you? I love you for your reception of me. Have I asked you for your
    money? No; you know better. I appeal to the poor. I say, Cursed
    be that man or woman who says that I have taken of your money
    unjustly. Brother Babbitt will address you. I have nothing in my
    heart but good feelings.

I rode out in the afternoon. On my return, my lawyers, Col. Richardson
and Almon W. Babbitt, called upon me on the subject of the writs which
were out against me.

[Sidenote: Threat to Kidnap Jeremiah Smith.]

A man called and informed me that John Eagle and several others
intended to kidnap Jeremiah Smith during the night. I therefore
stationed an extra police in order to protect him.

President Brigham Young arrived at Cincinnati at 5 p.m.

[Sidenote: President Smith Voluntarily goes to Carthage to Meet
Indictments.]

_Monday, 27.--_About 8 a.m., I started on horseback with a few friends,
went by the Temple, and purchased my course towards Carthage, thinking
it best for me to meet my enemies before the Circuit Court, and have
the indictments against me investigated. After I had passed my farm
on the prairie, most of the following brethren joined my company, and
the remainder soon after my arrival in Carthage--viz.: Aaron Johnson,
Dr. Bernhisel, Joseph W. Coolidge, John Hatfield, Orrin P. Rockwell,
Lorenzo Rockwell, William Walker, Harrison Sagers, Hyrum Smith, John
P. Greene, Judge William Richards, Shadrach Roundy, Theodore Turley,
Jedediah M. Grant, John Lytle, Joseph B. Noble, Edward Bonney, Lucien
Woodworth, Cornelius P. Lott, Johathan Dunham, and other friends.

{413} We arrived at Hamilton's hotel about noon. Charles A. Foster
overtook us three or four miles from the city, and accompanied us to
Carthage. I had considerable conversation with him, and he appeared to
be more mild than previously, and as though he was almost persuaded
that he had been influenced to some extent by false reports.

Joseph H. Jackson, Francis M. Higbee, and Chauncey L. Higbee were in
Hamilton's hotel when we arrived. Soon after our arrival there, Charles
A. Foster took me into a private room and told me in a friendly manner
that there was a conspiracy against my life. Robert D. Foster told some
of the brethren (with tears in his eyes) that there was evil determined
against me; and that there were some persons who were determined I
should not go out of Carthage alive. Jackson was seen to reload his
pistols, and was heard to swear he would have satisfaction of me and
Hyrum.

I had a short interview with Judge Thomas, who treated me with the
utmost courtesy. He is a great man and a gentleman. After dinner (at
the second or third table) we retired to our room, when Jackson, who
had been to the Court House, came towards the hotel. Some person told
him Hyrum had arrived, when he immediately turned towards the Court
House again.

My lawyers, Messrs. Richardson, Babbitt, and Skinner, used all
reasonable exertions to bring forward my trial on the charge of
perjury; but the prosecuting party were not ready,--one Withers, a
material witness (as they asserted in court), being absent.

My attorneys frequently called on me to report the state of things in
court, and I was ready to go in at a moment's warning, being anxious
for my trial; but the case was deferred till next term. I was left to
give bail to the sheriff at his option. He told me I might go home,
where he would call and take bail at his own convenience.

We immediately called for our horses; and while they {414} were being
harnessed, Chauncey L. Higbee came to me and wanted me to stay as
a witness in a certain case in which he was employed as attorney.
He urged me considerably, but I told him I did not recollect the
occurrence he referred to particularly enough to testify in the case,
and got him to excuse me.

[Sidenote: The Return to Nauvoo.]

At half-past four p.m., we started on our return; but when we had got
as far as Brother George D. Grant's, a heavy shower of rain commenced,
and I went into the house, while most of the brethren went into the
barn until the shower abated. After the storm had subsided, we went
forward, and I, Hyrum, and some others arrived at home about 9 p.m.,
and found Emma sick. My carriage, with Joseph B. Noble, arrived a
little after. It was upset on the Temple Hill, but no one was hurt. I
rode on horseback all the way on "Joe Duncan."

As we left the tavern in Carthage, and passed the Court House, there
were many people about in small groups. Jackson stood on the green with
one or two men some distance off.

While at Hamilton's, Chauncey L. Higbee offered some insulting language
concerning me to Orrin P. Rockwell, who resented it nobly as a friend
ought to do. Hamilton, seeing it, turned Rockwell out of doors.

It was afterwards reported to me by James Flack that Robert D. Foster,
Charles A. Foster, Wm. B. Rollinson, and the Higbees were on the hill
when I passed in the morning. They immediately gathered their pistols,
mounted their horses, and were in Carthage before me, excepting Charles
A. Foster.

Also Mr. Powers was talking with Mr. Davies, a tailor, about my going
to Carthage, and said they would attempt to kill Joseph Smith. Mr.
Davies replied, "O no, I think not." Mr. Powers rejoined, "They will,
by G--; and you know it, by G--."

Samuel Smith, of Montebello, heard at five this morning, {415} that I
had been taken prisoner to Carthage by a mob. He immediately gathered a
company of twenty-five men for the purpose of assisting me, and arrived
at Carthage about the time I did.

CASE OF JEREMIAH SMITH BEFORE MUNICIPAL COURT AT NAUVOO--AFFIDAVITS OF
CRIMES OF CHAUNCEY L. HIGBEE--APPEARANCE OF THE "EXPOSITOR."

_Tuesday, 28.--_At home all day. Rain in the afternoon. The _Maid of
Iowa_ started for the Iowa river at 11 a.m.

I received a letter from Mr. J. Bronder, dated Philadelphia, May 20th,
expressing his strong desires that I should allow my name to stand as
candidate for the Presidency of the United States, urging many reasons
for his request.

[Sidenote: Arrest of Jeremiah Smith, by U.S. Authority.]

Luther W. Hicock, of Burlington, Iowa, came in and arrested Jeremiah
Smith on a warrant issued by Nathanial Pope, Judge of the U. S. Circuit
Court. During our conversation in the afternoon we learned to our
mutual joy that Jeremiah Smith and I were of one origin.

Received the following letter:

    _Letter: D. S. Hollister to Joseph Smith--Presidential Election
    Matters_.

    BALTIMORE, May 9th, 1844.

    DEAR BROTHER JOSEPH.--From the time of my departure to that of my
    arrival here on Saturday last, I was blessed with prosperity. The
    feelings manifested by the passengers on the boat to St. Louis were
    quite favorable.

    At St. Louis I embarked on board the steamer _Valley Forge_, with
    about 125 cabin passengers. I gradually introduced myself to those
    whose faces gave indications of honest hearts and intelligent minds.

    On Sunday I was invited to give, in a public discourse, the points
    of difference between faith of the Latter-day Saints and other
    professors of {417} the Christian religion. There was a Methodist
    preacher on board, with whom arrangements were made, to follow
    me and blow Mormonism to the four winds. Well, I led off in a
    discourse of an hour and a half. After dinner the Methodists tried
    to rally their preacher; but he could not be induced to undertake
    the fulfillment of his engagements.

    I spent the time in conversing with groups of inquirers, and
    giving further information to those who sought it. After tea, the
    Methodist priest was, by much persuasion, induced to preach; but,
    to the astonishment of all, never once mentioned "Mormonism."

    By-the-by, we had a beautiful specimen of Missouri treatment of the
    Saints on board. While I was speaking, I referred to the many false
    statements which found their way to the public through the papers.
    A case in point was that of Joseph Smith having just discarded his
    wife.

    After I had finished speaking, and was standing on the guard of
    the boat, a Missourian stepped up to me, asking me if I wished
    to be understood that all who said Jo Smith had discarded his
    wife were liars. On my answering him in the affirmative, he drew
    his bowie knife on me; but some passengers, who had heard him
    threaten my life, were watching, and caught him as he was in the
    act of striking and I in the act of pitching him overboard; but
    they saved him, and I am glad of it. The whole affair turned much
    to my advantage. It was an ocular demonstration to the crowd of
    Missourians' feeling toward the Church of Christ.

    By this time the way was pretty well paved for introducing national
    matters; and from this on to our arrival at Wheeling, the time
    was principally occupied on that subject--reading your views on
    political economy, &c.

    On arriving at Wheeling, a stranger might have imagined me to be a
    man of some consequence, for it was, "Will you take a seat in our
    coach?" "Go with us in this stage." "Hold on, and take a seat with
    us," says the third. In fact, the Mormon was quite a lion among the
    passengers.

    But passing the minutiae, I arrived in the city two days after the
    great Whig convention. All is joy and enthusiasm among the Whigs,
    while doubt and consternation are manifested among the Democrats.
    The convention has been got up at an immense expense; hundreds of
    thousands of dollars have been expended.

    The Democratic convention comes off on the 27th inst. In the
    meantime I shall do what is in my power for the promotion of the
    good cause, and endeavor to be well accoutered for that occasion.
    I expect to co-operate with Hyde, Pratt and Page, though as yet I
    have not heard from them.

    {418} I shall expect to receive from you the proceedings of the
    convention held at Nauvoo on Monday last, together with such
    instructions as you deem proper to give.

    D. S. HOLLISTER.

[Sidenote: Municipal Court--Case of Jeremiah Smith.]

_Thursday, 30.--_Municipal Court met at 10 a.m., over which I presided
as mayor and chief justice. Present, William Marks, Orson Spencer,
George W. Harris, Gustavus Hills and Samuel Bennett, alderman,
associate justices Jeremiah Smith, Sen., was brought up on _habeas
corpus_ from the custody of T. B. Johnson, the complainant.

T. B. Johnson being called by the court answered that he did not
acknowledge the jurisdiction of this court; that his writ was only to
keep Smith until he could get another writ for him; that Mr. Hickock
had a writ from Judge Pope, and he considered Mr. Smith his prisoner,
and he attended this court as a matter of courtesy; and if any one
offered resistance, he was instructed by Government to give their
names, &c., and wrote the names of the court, &c.

Smith's counsel replied to such a subterfuge writ.

The court thought it due the court to hear the reasons why the
jurisdiction of the court was not regarded.

T. B. Johnson said he did not come to make a speech; but was instructed
to arrest the man. He intended to make no defense. He was an agent of
the United States. "Your writ of _habeas corpus_ had nothing more to
do with this case than with a man in the moon. I have not been able to
get authority, and did not come to make defense." Read from Charles B.
Penrose's handwriting (so purporting) 33 sec. of Act Sept. 24th, 1789,
Act of Congress. Had agreed to wait the decision of this court, but had
not agreed to abide the decision.

James A. McCanse was called by the court and asked, "Do you subscribe
to the decision of Mr. Johnson in the matter?"

McCanse would not decide. Would like counsel.

{419} T. B. Johnson said he did not ask any favors of the court. He was
a United States agent.

Councilor Hugins said--"If McCanse surrenders his claim we will not go
into the merits of the case; but if McCanse claims the prisoner, we
will go into the merits."

Councilor Hugins read a petition of Jeremiah Smith for another writ of
_habeas corpus._ G. P. Stiles, counsel for prisoner, said that Johnson
had given up the prisoner on the first claim.

T. B. Johnson said he did not surrender his claim; had nothing to say
about it. "Take your own course, gentlemen."

Stiles said he has given him up on the first writ, and now says he says
nothing about it; and upon this ground we claim a discharge.

T. B. Johnson said--"We would be defending the writ before Judge Pope.
I come here as an agent of the United States. The prisoner has been
taken out of my hand, I consider illegally. I do not come here to
prosecute or to defend a writ of _habeas corpus._ There is no law for
these proceedings. I know my rights. If this court thinks it right to
discharge the prisoner, let them do it--let them do it. I do not ask
any favors of the court--I ask justice. The laws of Illinois have no
power over the United States laws. Let this court discharge him, and I
shall take another course--I do not say against you as a court. I came
here to arrest Jeremiah Smith."

Justice Harris asked if he meant to intimidate the court by threats.

The chief justice remarked that it was the duty of the United States
and Federal Government to treat their subjects and constituents with
all that complacency and good feeling which they wished in return,
and to avoid every threatening aspect, every intimidating and harsh
treatment. He respected the United States laws, but would not yield
up any right ceded to the court. The United States have no right to
trample our laws under their feet. {420} The court is bound by oath to
support the Constitution of the United States, and State of Illinois
and writ of_ habeas corpus._ The Constitution of the United States and
_habeas corpus_ shall not be denied. If the court deny the writ of
_habeas corpus,_ they perjure themselves. The United States have no
right to usurp power to intimidate, and the court would see them all
destroyed before he would perjure himself. We have asked no power. Mr.
Smith asked us to investigate. We were bound to do so. Let the Federal
Government hurl on us their forces, dragoons, &c.; we are not to be
intimidated. The court is clothed with _habeas corpus,_ [power] and
will execute it according to the law. "I understand some law and more
justice, and know as much about the rights of American citizens as any
man."

T. B. Johnson said--"If I did say anything indecorous to the court, I
take it back."

Court responded--"All is right."

Court ordered that the prisoner be discharged, the complainant having
refused to prosecute his claim; and that judgment be entered up _v._ T.
B. Johnson, as agent, for costs of suit.

Afterwards another petition for another writ of _habeas corpus_ was
presented and the writ issued and tried. I copy the minutes from the
municipal docket:

    _Municipal Court Minutes in the case of Jeremiah Smith_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO, Municipal Court.

    _United States, vs. Jeremiah Smith, on Habeas Corpus_.

    May 30th, 1844, came Jeremiah Smith, and upon the reading and
    filing the petition for a writ of _habeas corpus_ to be directed
    to one Luther W. Hickock to have forthwith before the Municipal
    Court the body of the said Jeremiah Smith upon said writ. Said
    writ was granted by the court in accordance with the prayer of the
    petitioner.

    The writ of _habeas corpus_ was served instanter by the Marshal
    in court and petitioner present; which writ with Marshal's return
    thereon, is on file in the clerk's office.

    {421} The foregoing petition of said Jeremiah Smith, together
    with a certified copy of the warrant, by virtue of which the said
    Hickock held the said Jeremiah Smith in custody, are on file in the
    clerk's office.

    Present, Joseph Smith, mayor and chief justice; and William Marks,
    Orson Spencer, George W. Harris, Gustavus Hills, and Samuel
    Bennett, aldermen, associate justices.

    Luther W. Hickock was called by the court to answer in the case,
    who said he had a writ from Judge Pope, and should consider Smith
    his prisoner until he was compelled to give him up. Wanted an
    adjournment.

    The court informed Hickock that Smith was their prisoner.

    H. T. Hugins and George P. Stiles, counsel for Smith, objected to
    an adjournment, as there had been two weeks adjournment for the
    Government to procure witnesses in another suit which had closed,
    arising out of the same case, and which had been abandoned by the
    prosecuting party.

    T. B. Johnson appeared before the court and said--"I stand here
    as an agent for the Government to act in the case of Smith in
    any state where he may be found; and if we are to go into an
    investigation on the merits of the case, and go behind the writ,
    I must have time to send to Washington for witnesses; and I am
    instructed to consult with Justin Butterfield, Esq., Governor
    Chambers of Iowa, and Mr. McPherson of St. Louis."

    The marshal, J. P. Greene, presented the prisoner for trial.

    The court ordered the marshal to take charge of the prisoner, and
    have him forthcoming from time to time for trial.

    Hickock asked for an adjournment until afternoon.

    Hugins said--"If they want to go into the merits of the case,
    we will give them any time; but we propose to dispense with the
    merits, and move a discharge on the insufficiency of the papers.
    Dr. Hickock has no legal authority to arrest the prisoner," and
    read from page 51, Revised Statutes of Illinois, sec. 399.

    T. B. Johnson said he could show the law different, and asked for
    one week's adjournment.

    One o'clock p.m., court adjourned until after dinner to hear the
    pleas.

    Three o'clock, p.m., court sat, the same as in the morning.

    H. T. Hugins and George P. Stiles, counsel for Smith, read and
    filed their plea, moving the court that said Smith be discharged,
    and suffered to go at large.

    1st. Because the person issuing the warrant on which he has been
    arrested is unauthorized to issue the same.

    2nd. Because the process has been issued in a case and under
    circumstances where the law does not allow process.

    {422} 3rd. Because the person having custody of said Smith is
    unauthorized to execute the warrant under which he is acting, and
    is not the person empowered by law to detain him.

    4th. Because said Smith has been, by and before a competent court,
    legally examined and discharged in relation to the subject matter
    set forth in said warrant.

    5th. Because said writ is defective in a substantial form required
    by law.

    L. W. Hickock was called, and persisted in considering the
    authority under which he acted good and sufficient.

    Counselor Hugins urged the first and second count in his plea, and
    read from the Constitution of the United States, Art. 4, 2nd sec,
    2nd part, 3rd count, read Revised Statutes of Illinois, page 51,
    sec. 399, and page 324; 4th count, read the certificate of John S.
    Dunlap, clerk of the District Court for the county of Des Moines,
    Iowa Territory, dated May 21st, 1844, a copy of which is on file in
    the clerk's office.

    L. W. Hickock said he had nothing to say; and the case was
    submitted.

    DECISION--The court are of opinion, when they take into
    consideration their oath to support the Constitution of the United
    States, that the certificate of John S. Dunlap, clerk of the
    District Court for the county of Des Moines, Territory of Iowa,
    is sufficient to authorize the discharge or the prisoner, because
    the Constitution says no person shall twice be put in jeopardy
    of life for the same offense. The decision of the court is that
    the prisoner be discharged on all the points for which plea has
    been made in his behalf, and that judgment be entered against the
    prosecutor for cost.

Evening, T. B. Johnson was going to Burlington. Jeremiah Smith swore
out an execution for $77.75. Mr. Johnson acknowledged the fee bill, and
afterwards threatened to bring the dragoons in order to get Jeremiah
Smith.

Mr. Hickock called for a copy of the proceedings of the Municipal Court.

I wrote the following letter to Judge Pope:--

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Judge Pope Introducing Jeremiah Smith_.

    NAUVOO, May 30, 1844.

    SIR,--Permit me to introduce to your particular notice and
    confidence as "brethren of the mystic tie," Mr. Jeremiah Smith
    of Iowa Territory, and Mr. H. T. Hugins of Burlington, in said
    Territory Mr. Smith is a gentleman whose statements can be relied
    on, and Mr. Hugins a lawyer, {423} of sound principles, as well
    as promising talents; and I always take pleasure in extending the
    reputations of honorable men among honorable men, especially when
    it appears to me that the benevolence and clemency extended by me
    is needed and merited by worthy men. Conscious, too, that your
    Honor is liberal and just in your sphere, and will appreciate "the
    golden rule," I have only to greet you with my best wishes for your
    welfare and happiness.

    Respectfully, I have the honor to be,

    Your humble servant,

    Then and there personally appeared before me, Joseph Smith, Mayor
    of the City of Nauvoo, the undersigned H. T. Hugins, of Burlington,
    Iowa Territory, and made solemn oath that Thomas B. Johnson did,
    on the 30th day of May, 1844, declare in his presence that he
    intended to bring dragoons and troops of the United States from
    Iowa Territory into this city, for the purpose of resisting the
    authority and power of the Municipal Court of said city, and that
    he should disregard entirely the authority of said court, and
    that he deemed the authority of said court of no effect. Deponent
    further states that said Johnson, in his said conversation, had
    reference to the case of Jeremiah Smith, which had been decided by
    said court.

    H. T. HUGINS.

    Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 31st day of May, 1844.

    WM. W. PHELPS, Clerk M. C.

Upon the foregoing affidavit, I issued a _capias_ to arrest Thomas
B. Johnson for threatening the peace of the city with United States
dragoons. At 10 a.m., called at my {424} office. At 1 p.m., called to
see Sister Richards, who was sick. I administered to her the laying on
of hands, when she felt better. Afternoon I attended general council,
when Brother Emmett made his report. Rode out in the evening to Van
Orden's, and paid him $100. Two or three Indians staid in the hall at
night.

_Saturday, June 1.--_At home. Some gentle showers.

At one, p.m., I rode out with Dr. Richards and Orrin P. Rockwell.
Called on Davis at the boat. Paid Manhard $90. Met George J. Adams, and
paid him $50. Then went to John P. Greene's, and paid him and another
brother $200. Called at William Clayton's, while Dr. Richards and Orrin
P. Rockwell called at the doctor's new house. Returned home at 4:30 p.m.

At 8 p.m., Peter Maughan, John Saunders, and Jacob Peart called at Dr.
Richards' to consult about a coal-bed on Rock River. I suggested it
would be profitable to employ the _Maid of Iowa_ in the business of
carrying the coal, &c; and all approved of this plan.

President Brigham Young and Elder John E. Page held a conference in
Pittsburg.

I received the following letter:--

    _Joel H. Walker to Joseph Smith--Proposes to Join Prophet in
    Western Volunteer Movement_.

    BOSTON, May 9th, 1844.

    MY DEAR SIR.--Being so closely confined in the postoffice in this
    city, where I have been but a short time, I have not, before this
    morning been aware that you had petitioned Congress in relation to
    raising a military force to protect our Southern Frontier.

    My purpose in addressing you is to offer my services, either in
    military or civil duty, as I am so much confined that my health
    must suffer if I remain a great length of time.

    If I can make myself known to you by reputation which I think
    possible, I have every confidence, if in your power, you will favor
    my wishes.

    At any rate, I hope you will write me at your earliest convenience
    upon receipt of this.

    {425} I was born in Peacham, Vermont, October 14th, 1813. My
    father is Col. Joel Walker, now of Belvidere, Illinois. Hon. E.
    Peck, of Springfield, Illinois, is my brother-in-law. I was in the
    mercantile business in Chicago from 1836 to '39, (one of the firm
    of King, Walker & Co.,) since which time I have been here, with
    the exception of a year; have been in the military since the age
    of sixteen, and am considered somewhat proficient, having devoted
    much attention to the study of its principles, and an ardent love
    for the art. I have received a good academical and mercantile
    education; and if there is in your place anything which would be
    for our mutual advantage,

    I am yours respectfully,

    JOEL HAMILTON WALKER.

    GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH, Nauvoo.

I replied as follows:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Joel H. Walker_.

    NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, June 1st 1844.

    SIR.--Yours of May 9th is before me, and according to my custom I
    answer off hand. I have not yet ascertained whether Congress will,
    by special act, authorize me to protect our beloved country. If it
    should, I have not a doubt but your services could be agreeably
    used.

    As to what you could do in Nauvoo, I am unable to say. Gentlemen
    with a small capital, or a large one, can easily employ it to good
    advantage, our city is so rapidly improving.

    Truth, virtue, and honor, combined with energy and industry, pave
    the way to exaltation, glory and bliss.

    Respectfully, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    FRIEND SMITH.--I have just received intimation that there is a
    project on foot here to visit Nauvoo with a body of from five to
    six hundred armed men, for the purpose of liberating Dr. Hickock,
    who, it is stated, is confined in your prison. I, as a friend to
    your society, consider it my duty to make you aware of the danger
    you may be in, that you may be prepared to meet them. I think it
    best to keep my name from you, for were it known here that I had
    given notice of their proceedings, it would not be safe for me to
    remain. Do not think it a humbug, and treat it lightly; but prepare
    yourselves for the coming storm. From what I can learn, they intend
    going on the next boat. I hope this may reach you in time.

    I am, with respect, your friend,

    for the salvation of the souls of men, we take pleasure in feeling
    after you; and therefore would, in the sincerity of men of God,
    advise you to be rebaptized by Elder Nickerson, one of the servants
    of God, that you may again receive the sweet influences of the Holy
    Ghost, and enjoy the fellowship of the Saints.

    The law of God requires it, and you cannot be too good. Patience
    is heavenly, obedience is noble, forgiveness is merciful, and
    exaltation is godly; and he that holds out faithful to the end
    shall in no wise lose his reward. A good man will endure all things
    to honor Christ, and even dispose of the whole world, and all in
    it, to save his soul. Grace for grace is a heavenly decree, and
    union is power where wisdom guides.

    Respectfully,

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    HYRUM SMITH.

The Municipal Court issued an execution against Francis M. Higbee for
$36.26 1/2 for costs incurred on 8th May last.

[Sidenote: Prosecution of the Laws and Fosters Discussed.]

At 6 p.m. I was in council with Elders John Taylor, Hyrum Smith,
Willard Richards, Almon W. Babbitt, Lucien Woodworth, and William
W. Phelps on the propriety of prosecuting the Laws and Fosters for
perjury, slander, &c. Counseled Taylor to go on with the prosecution
in behalf of Maria Lawrence. I concluded to go to Quincy with Taylor,
and give up my bonds of guardianship as administrator of the Lawrence
estate.

Alpheus Cutler and Reynolds Cahoon are so anxious to get property, they
will all flat out as soon as the Temple is completed and the faith of
the Saints ceases from them, &c.

{428} At 7 p.m. I walked out with Lucien Woodworth.

_Wednesday, 5.--_I went to the prairie to show some land, and returned
home towards night.

At 8 p.m. I walked out with Dr. Richards. The lightning in the north
was most beautiful. About 10 a shower of rain passed over, with
continued distant thunder. There has not been any rain for some days
back. Thermometer stood at 94 1/2 degrees in the shade. Very warm.

I received a book entitled _"An Original History of the Religious
Denominations at Present Existing in the United States_," [1] and wrote
the following acknowledgment:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to L. Daniel Rupp--Book on Religious Sects_.

    NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, June 5th, 1844.

    DEAR SIR.--He pasa Ek-klesia, &c., together with your note, has
    safely reached me, and I feel very thankful for so valuable a
    treasure. The design, the propriety, the wisdom of letting every
    sect tell its own story, and the elegant manner in which the work
    appears, have filled my breast with encomiums upon it, wishing you
    God speed.

    Although all is not gold that shines, any more than every religious
    creed is sanctioned with the so eternally sure word of prophecy,
    satisfying all doubt with "Thus saith the Lord;" yet, "by proving
    contraries," truth is made manifest," and a wise man can search out
    "old paths, wherein righteous men held communion with Jehovah, and
    were exalted through obedience.

    I shall be pleased to furnish further information at a proper time,
    and render you such further service as the work and vast extension
    of our Church may demand for the benefit of truth, virtue and
    holiness.

    Your work will be suitably noticed in our papers for your benefit.

    With great respect, I have the honor to be,

    Your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

_Thursday, 6.--_About 9 a.m. I ordered my carriage for a ride; but it
stood at the door till nearly noon, while I read my letter to Henry
Clay to many strangers, in the {429} bar-room, [2] among whom was one
who advocated the claims of Henry Clay for the presidency. I argued
with him for a long time to show the subject in its true light, and
that no man could honestly vote for a man like Clay, who had violated
his oath, and not acted on constitutional principles.

About half-past twelve Dimick B. Huntington came and said that Robert
D. Foster felt very bad, and he thought there was a chance for his
return, if he could be reinstated in his office in the Legion, &c.,
&c.; and that Foster had all the affidavits of the anti-Mormons under
his control. I told Huntington that if Foster would return, withdraw
all the suits he had commenced, and do right, he should be restored.

I rode out in the carriage with several persons for an hour or two. At
7 p.m. a heavy shower of rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning,
and another shower at 9. p.m.

I issued the following caution to the public:

    Having once notified the public against receiving a certain
    currency called "Kirtland Safety Society;" I again caution all
    persons against receiving or trading in said paper money, as
    all that was issued as genuine was redeemed. After the first
    officers who signed said bills retired, a new set of officers
    were appointed, and the vault of the institution was broken open
    and robbed of several hundred thousand dollars, the signatures
    forged upon the said stolen bills, and those bills are being slyly
    bartered or had in trade, for the purpose of wilful and malicious
    prosecution and collection.

    In the first place the bills are not collectable by law in an
    unchartered institution. In the second place, they are spurious,
    the signature being a forgery, and every person passing or trading
    a bill is guilty of passing counterfeit money, besides the
    bare-faced act of swindling. And lastly, he that uses said bills
    in any way, as a medium of trade is guilty of fraud, and shows a
    wicked and corrupt determination to willfully, maliciously and
    feloniously rob the Latter-day Saints; and if the executors of the
    laws are as ready to mete out even handed justice to such {430} men
    as the Mormons, more indictments will indicate more honesty. Time
    will show.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

[Sidenote: Prophet's Conversation with Dr. Foster.]

_Friday, 7.--_Robert D. Foster called professedly to make some
concessions in order to return to the Church. He wanted a private
interview, which I declined. I had some conversation with him in the
hall, in the presence of several gentlemen. I told him I would meet
with him in the presence of friends. I would choose three or four,
and he might choose an equal number, and that I was willing to settle
everything on righteous principles. In the evening a report was
circulated that Foster had said that I would receive him back on any
terms, and give him a hat full of dollars into the bargain.

I went to the printing office about 2 p.m., and instructed Elder John
Taylor to answer a certain bill or receipt of George W. Harris.

[Sidenote: First number of the_ Expositor_.]

The first and only number of the _Nauvoo Expositor_ was published,
edited by Sylvester Emmons.

In the evening I received an extremely saucy and insulting letter from
Robert D. Foster. Pleasant evening.

_Saturday, 8.--_From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in City Council; also from
3 to 6:30 p.m. The subject the _Nauvoo Expositor_ was taken under
consideration. An ordinance was passed concerning the City Attorney and
his duties.

Elder Jedediah M. Grant preached in the Mansion this evening. Thunder
and rain this evening and during the night.

A ferry-boat came down from Burlington with a pleasure party, and
landed at the Nauvoo House at 2 p.m.

I sent William Clayton to Carthage to give in some lots for
assessments; and while there Backenstos told him that Walter Bagby had
been gone eight days to Missouri to try to get another writ for me.
Brother Clayton also got {431} news that the Democrats had dropped Van
Buren, and substituted James K. Polk, of Tennessee for president, and
Silas Wright of New York, for vice-president.

I walked out in the evening with Brother Clayton.

[Sidenote: Conference at Pleasant Valley, Michigan.]

A conference was held at Pleasant Valley, Michigan. Present of the
Twelve, Wilford Woodruff, and George A. Smith. Elder Wilford Woodruff
presided. Six branches were represented, comprising 89 members, 5
Elders, 2 Priests, 4 Teachers, and 3 Deacons. Five Elders were ordained.

_Sunday, 9.--_At home. My health not very good, in consequence of my
lungs being impaired by so much public speaking. My brother Hyrum
preached at the Stand.

At 2 p.m. several passengers of the steamer _Osprey_ from St. Louis and
Quincy arrived, and put up at the Mansion. I helped to carry in their
trunks, and chatted with them in the bar-room.

There was a meeting at the Mansion at 6 p.m.

CHAPTER XX.

THE DESTRUCTION OF THE "NAUVOO EXPOSITOR"--PROCEEDINGS OF THE NAUVOO
CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR.

[Sidenote: _Nauvoo Expositor_ before Nauvoo City Council.]

_Monday, June 10, 1844.--_I was in the City Council from 10 a.m., to
1:20 p.m., and from 2:20 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. investigating the merits
of the _Nauvoo Expositor,_ and also the conduct of the Laws, Higbees,
Fosters, and others, who have formed a conspiracy for the purpose of
destroying my life, and scattering the Saints or driving them from the
state.

[Sidenote: Ordinance on Libels.]

An ordinance was passed concerning libels. The Council passed an
ordinance declaring the_ Nauvoo Expositor_ a nuisance, and also issued
an order to me to abate the said nuisance. I immediately ordered the
Marshal to destroy it without delay, and at the same time issued an
order to Jonathan Dunham, acting Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion, to
assist the Marshal with the Legion, if called upon so to do.

About 8 p.m., the Marshal returned and reported that he had removed the
press, type, printed paper, and fixtures into the street, and destroyed
them. This was done because of the libelous and slanderous character
of the paper, its avowed intention being to destroy the municipality
and drive the Saints from the city. The _posse_ accompanied by some
hundreds of the citizens, returned with the Marshal to the front of
the Mansion, when I gave them a short address, and told them they had
done right and that not a hair of their heads should be hurt for it;
that they had executed the orders which were given me by {433} the City
Council; that I would never submit to have another libelous publication
established in the city; that I did not care how many papers were
printed in the city, if they would print the truth: but would submit
to no libels or slanders from them. I then blessed them in the name
of the Lord. This speech was loudly greeted by the assembly with
three-times-three cheers. The _posse_ and assembly then dispersed all
in good order. Francis M. Higbee and others made some threats.

East wind. Very cold and cloudy.

I here insert the

    _Ordinance Concerning Libels and for Other Purposes_.

    Whereas the Saints in all ages of the world have suffered
    persecution and death by wicked and corrupt men under the garb
    of a mere holy appearance of religion; and whereas the Church
    of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, from the moment that its
    first truth sprang out of the earth till now, has been persecuted
    with death, destruction, and extermination; and, whereas men to
    fulfill the Scriptures that a man's enemies are they of his own
    household, have turned traitors in the Church, and combined and
    leagued with the most corrupt scoundrels and villains that disgrace
    the earth unhung, for the Heaven-daring and damnable purpose of
    revenge on account of disappointed lust, disappointed projects
    of speculation, fraud, and unlawful designs to rob and plunder
    mankind with impunity; and, whereas such wicked and corrupt men
    have greatly facilitated their unlawful designs, horrid intentions,
    and murderous plans by polluting, degrading and converting
    the blessings and utility of the press to the sin-smoking and
    blood-stained ruin of innocent communities--by publishing lies,
    false statements, coloring the truth, slandering men, women,
    children, societies, and countries--by polishing the characters
    of blacklegs, highwaymen, and murderers as virtuous; and whereas
    a horrid, bloody, secret plan, upheld, sanctioned and largely
    patronized by men in Nauvoo and out of it, who boast that all they
    want for the word _go_, to exterminate or ruin the Latter day
    Saints, is for them to do one unlawful act, and the work shall be
    done, is now fostered, cherished, and maturing in Nauvoo,--by men,
    too, who helped to obtain the very charter they would break, and
    some of them drew up and voted for the very ordinances they are
    striving to use as a scarecrow to frighten the surrounding country
    in rebellion, mobbing, and war; and whereas, while the blood of
    {434} our brethren from wells, holes and naked prairies, and the
    ravishment of female virtue from Missouri, and the smoke from the
    altars of infamy, prostituted by John C. Bennett, and continued in
    the full tide of experiment and disgraceful damnation by the very
    self-called fragments of a body of degraded men that have got up
    a press in Nauvoo to destroy the charter of the city--to destroy
    Mormonism, men, women, and children as Missouri did; by force of
    arms--by fostering laws that emanate from corruption and betray
    with a kiss; wherefore to honor the State of Illinois, and those
    patriots who gave the charter, and for the benefit, convenience,
    health, and happiness of said city:--

    Sec. 1. Be it ordained by the City Council of Nauvoo that if any
    person or persons shall write or publish in said city any false
    statement or libel any of the citizens, for the purpose of exciting
    the public mind against the chartered privileges, peace, and good
    order of said city, or shall slander (according to the definition
    of slander or libel by Blackstone or Kent, or the act in the
    statute of Illinois,) any portion of the inhabitants of said city,
    or bribe any portion of the citizens of said city for malicious
    purposes, or in any manner or form excite the prejudice of the
    community against any portion of the citizens of said city, for
    evil purposes, he, she, or they shall be deemed disturbers of the
    peace; and, upon conviction before the Mayor or Municipal Court,
    shall be fined in any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or
    imprisoned six months, or both, at the discretion of said Mayor or
    court.

    Sec. 2. Be it further ordained that nothing in the foregoing
    section shall be so construed as to interfere with the right of any
    person to be tried by a jury of his vicinage, with the freedom of
    speech or the liberty of the press, according to the most liberal
    meaning of the Constitution, the dignity of freemen, the voice of
    truth, and the rules of virtue.

    Sec. 3. And be it further ordained that this ordinance shall be in
    force from and after its passage.

    Passed June 10th, 1844.

    GEO. W. HARRIS, President, pro tem.

    W. RICHARDS, Recorder.

I also insert a brief synopsis of the proceedings of the City Council
of the city of Nauvoo, relative to the destruction of the press and
fixtures of the _Nauvoo Expositor_.

    _Synopsis of Proceedings in the City Council against the Nauvoo
    Expositor_.

    CITY COUNCIL, REGULAR SESSION,

    June 8th, 1844.

    In connection with other business as stated in last week's paper,
    the {435} Mayor remarked that he believed it generally the case,
    that when a man goes to law, he has an unjust cause, and wants to
    go before some one who wants business, and that he had very few
    cases on his docket; and referring to Councilor Emmons, editor of
    the _Nauvoo Expositor,_ suggested the propriety of first purging
    the City Council; and, referring to the character of the paper
    and proprietors, called up Theodore Turley, a mechanic, who being
    sworn, said that the Laws (William and Wilson,) had brought bogus
    dies to him to fix.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith inquired what good Foster and his brother and
    the Higbees and Laws had ever done. While his brother Joseph was
    under arrest from the Missouri persecution, the Laws and Robert
    D. Foster would have been ridden on a rail, if he had not stepped
    forward to prevent it, on account of their oppressing the poor.

    Mayor said, while he was under arrest by writ from Governor Carlin
    William Law sued him for $40 he was owing Law, and it took the last
    expense money he had to pay it.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith referred to J. H. Jackson's coming to this
    city, &c. Mayor said that William Law had offered Jackson $500 to
    kill him.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith continued--Jackson told him he (Jackson)
    meant to have his daughter, and threatened him if he made any
    resistance. Jackson related to him a dream, that Joseph and Hyrum
    were opposed to him, but that he would execute his purposes; that
    Jackson had laid a plan with four or five persons to kidnap his
    daughter, and threatened to shoot any one that should come near
    after he had got her in the skiff; that Jackson was engaged in
    trying to make bogus, which was his principal business. Referred
    to the revelation read to the High Council of the Church, which
    has caused so much talk, about multiplicity of wives; that said
    revelation was in answer to a question concerning things which
    transpired in former days. That when sick, William Law confessed
    to him that he had been guilty of adultery, and was not fit to
    live, and had sinned against his own soul, &c., and inquired who
    was Judge Emmons? When he came here he had scarce two shirts to his
    back; but he had been dandled by the authorities of the city, &c.,
    and was now editor of the _Nauvoo Expositor,_ and his right hand
    man, was Francis M. Higbee, who had confessed to him that he had
    had the--!

    Washington Peck sworn, said--"Soon after Joseph H. Jackson came
    here, he came to witness to borrow money, which witness loaned him
    and Cook some jewelry as security."

    Soon after a man from across the river came after the jewelry.
    Jackson had stolen the jewelry from him.

    {436} At another time wanted to get money of witness. Asked witness
    if he would do anything dishonorable to get a living. Witness said
    he would not. Jackson said witness was a damn fool, for he could
    get a living, a deal easier than he was then doing, by making
    bogus; and some men high in the Church, are engaged in the business.

    Witness asked if it was Joseph. "No," said Jackson; "I dare not
    tell it to Joseph." Witness understood him the Laws are engaged in
    it. Jackson said he would be the death of witness, if he ever went
    to Joseph, or anyone else, to tell what he had said.

    AFTERNOON.--Ordered by the Council that Sylvester Emmons be
    suspended until his case could be investigated, for slandering the
    City Council. That the Recorder notify him of his suspension, and
    that his case would come up for investigation at the next regular
    session of the Council. (The order is in the hands of the Marshal).

    Councilor John Taylor said that Council or Emmons helped to make
    the ordinances of the city, and had never lifted his voice against
    them in the Council, and was now trying to destroy the ordinances
    and the charter.

    Lorenzo Wasson sworn, said Joseph H. Jackson had told witness that
    bogus-making was going on in the city; but it was too damned small
    business. Wanted witness to help him to procure money, for the
    General (Smith) was afraid to go into it; and with $500 he could
    get an engraving for bills on the Bank of Missouri, and one on the
    State of New York, and could make money. Said many times witness
    did not know him. Believed the General had been telling witness
    something. "G--d d--n him; if he has, I will kill him; Swore he
    would kill any man that should prove a traitor to him," Jackson
    said, if he could get a company of men to suit him, he would go
    into the frontiers and live by highway robbery; had got sick of the
    world.

    Mayor suggested that the Council pass an ordinance to prevent
    misrepresentations and libelous publications and conspiracies
    against the peace of the city; and, referring to the reports that
    Dr. Foster has set afloat, said he had never made any proposals
    to Foster to come back to the Church. Foster proposed to come
    back; came to Mayor's house, and wanted a private interview. Had
    some conversation with Foster in the hall, in presence of several
    gentlemen, on the 7th inst. Offered to meet him and have an
    interview in presence of friends, three or four, to be selected by
    each party; which Foster agreed to, and went to bring his friends
    for the interview; and the next notice he had of him was the
    following letter:--

    {437} TO GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH:

    June 7th, 1844.

    SIR,--I have consulted my friends in relation to your proposals of
    settlement, and they as well as myself, are of opinion that your
    conduct, and that of your unworthy, unprincipled clan, is so base,
    that it would be morally wrong, and detract from the dignity of
    gentlemen, to hold any conference with you. The repeated insults
    and abuses I, as well as my friends, have suffered from your
    unlawful course towards us, demands honorable resentment. We are
    resolved to make this our motto.

    Nothing on our part has been done to provoke your anger, but have
    done all things as become men. You have trampled upon everything
    we hold dear and sacred. You have set all law at defiance, and
    profaned the name of the Most High to carry out your damnable
    purposes; and I have nothing more to fear from you than you have
    already threatened; and I, as well as my friends, will stay here
    and maintain and magnify the law as long as we stay; and we are
    resolved never to leave until we sell or exchange our property that
    we have here.

    The proposals made by your agent, Dimick Huntington, as well as
    the threats you sent to intimidate me, I disdain and despise as I
    do their unhallowed author. The right of my family and my friends
    demands at my hand a refusal of all your offers. We are united in
    virtue and truth, and we set hell at defiance, and all her agents.
    Adieu.

    R. D. FOSTER.

    Mayor continued--And when Foster left his house, he went to a shoe
    shop on the hill, and reported that Joseph said to him, if he
    would come back he would give him Law's place in the Church, and a
    hat-full of specie.

    Lucien Woodworth sworn. Said that the conversation as stated by the
    Mayor was correct. Was at the Mansion June 7th, when Dr. Foster
    rode up and inquired if General Smith was at home. Dr. Foster
    went into the house; witness followed. Dr. Foster was there, the
    General, and others, looking at some specimens of penmanship.
    Something was said respecting a conversation at that time between
    the General and the Doctor, Gen. Smith observed to Foster, if
    he had a conversation, he would want others present. The Doctor
    said he would have a word with him by himself, and went into the
    hall. Witness went to the door that he might see and hear what
    was passing. They still continued to talk on the subject of a
    conversation that they might have afterwards with others present,
    whom Mr. Smith and Foster might choose. Foster left, and went for
    those that he said he wanted present, {438} and would return soon
    with them. He heard all the conversation. Heard nothing about Gen.
    Smith's making any offers to Foster to settle.

    Mayor said he wished it distinctly understood that he knew nothing
    about Dimick Huntington going to see Foster.

    Woodworth said he sent Dimick Huntington to Foster, and Joseph knew
    nothing about it.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith said Dimick Huntington came to him on the 7th
    inst. and said he had had an interview with Dr. Foster, and thought
    he was about ready to come back, and a word from him or Joseph
    would bring it about.

    Mayor said--"The conduct of such men and such papers are calculated
    to destroy the peace of the city, and it is not safe that such
    thing should exist, on account of the mob spirit which they tend
    to produce." He had made the statements he had, and called the
    witnesses to prepare the council to act in the case.

    Emmons was blackguarded out of Philadelphia, and dubbed with
    the title of Judge (as he had understood from citizens of
    Philadelphia); was poor, and Mayor helped him to cloth for a coat
    before he went away last fall, and he (Emmons) labored all winter
    to get the postoffice from Mr. Rigdon (as informed).

    Mayor referred to a writing from Dr. Goforth, showing that the
    Laws presented the communication from the Female Relief Society in
    the_ Nauvoo Neighbor_ to Dr. Goforth, as the bone of contention,
    and said if God ever spake by any man, it will not be five years
    before this city is in ashes and we in our graves, unless we go to
    Oregon, California or some other place, if the city does not put
    down everything which tends to mobocracy, and put down murderers,
    bogus-makers, and scoundrels. All the sorrow he ever had in his
    family in this city has arisen through the influence of William Law.

    Councilor H. Smith spoke in relation to the Laws, Fosters, Higbees,
    editor of the _Signal,_ &c., and of the importance of suppressing
    that spirit which has driven us from Missouri, &c.; that he would
    go in for an effective ordinance.

    Mayor said, at the time Governor Carlin was pursuing him with his
    writs, William Law came to his house with a band of Missourians for
    the purpose of betraying him. Came to his gate, and was prevented
    by Daniel Carn, who was set to watch. Law came within his gate and
    called, "Mayor," and the Mayor reproved Law for coming at that time
    of night with a company of strangers.

    Daniel Carn sworn. Said that about ten o'clock at night a boat
    came up the river with about a dozen men. William Law came to the
    gate with them. Witness on guard, stopped them. Law called Joseph
    to {439} the door, and wanted an interview. Joseph said--"Brother
    Law, you know better than to come here at this hour of the night,"
    and Law retired. Next morning Law wrote a letter to apologize,
    which witness heard read, which was written apparently to screen
    himself from the censure of a conspiracy; and the letter betrayed a
    conspiracy on the face of it.

    Adjourned at half-past 6 p.m. till Monday, 10th, 10 o'clock a.m.

    Adjourned session, June 10th, 10 o'clock a.m. Alderman Harris
    presiding.

    Mayor referred to Dr. Foster, and again read his letter of the 7th
    instant (as before quoted).

    Cyrus Hills (a stranger) sworn. Said one day last week, believed
    it Wednesday, a gentleman whom witness did not know, came into the
    sitting room of the Nauvoo Mansion, and requested the Hon. Mayor
    to step aside; he wanted to speak with him. Mayor stepped through
    the door into the entry by the foot of the stairs, and the General
    (Mayor) asked him what he wished? Foster (as witness learned since
    was his name) said he wanted some conversation on some business
    witness did not understand at the time. The General refused to go
    any farther, and said he would have no conversation in private,
    and what should be said should be in public, and told Foster, if
    he would choose three or four men, he would meet him with the same
    number of men (among whom was his brother Hyrum), and they would
    have a cool and calm investigation of the subject; and by his
    making a proper satisfaction, things should be honorably adjusted.
    Witness judged, from the manner in which Foster expressed himself,
    that he agreed to the Mayor's proposals, and would meet him the
    same day in the presence of friends. Heard no proposals made by
    Major to Foster for settlement. Heard nothing about any offers
    of dollars, or money, or any other offer except those mentioned
    before. Nothing said about William Law. Was within hearing of the
    parties at the time conversation was going on.

    Orrin P. Rockwell sworn. Some day last week saw Dr. Foster ride
    up to the Nauvoo Mansion and go in. Witness went in and found the
    Mayor and Dr. Foster in conversation. General Smith was naming the
    men he would have present, among whom were Hyrum Smith, William
    Marks, Lucien Woodworth, and Peter Haws; and Dr. Foster had leave
    to call an equal number of his friends, as witness understood, for
    the purpose of having an interview on some matters in contention.

    The Doctor's brother was proposed. General said he had no
    objection; wanted him present. Dr. Foster started, saying he would
    be back shortly. Before Dr. Foster left, the men whom General Smith
    had named to be present at the conversation were sent for.

    {440} Cross-examined. Witness went into the house as Mayor and Dr.
    Foster were coming out of the bar-room into the hall. Nothing said
    by the Mayor to Dr. Foster about his coming back. Made no offer to
    Foster about a settlement.

    Mayor said the first thing that occurred to his mind, when
    he stepped into the hall with Foster, was that he wanted to
    assassinate him. He saw something shining below his vest. Mayor put
    his finger on it and said--"What is that?" Foster replied--"It's my
    pistol," and immediately took out the pistol, and showed it openly,
    and wanted the Mayor to go with him alone. Mayor said he would not
    go alone. Mayor never saw the pistol before. Had a hook on its side
    to hang on his waist-band.

    Andrew L. Lamoreaux sworn. Said that in 1839 or '40, while
    President Joseph Smith, Elder Rigdon, Judge Higbee, Orrin P.
    Rockwell, and Dr. Robert D. Foster were on their way to Washington,
    called at witness' house in Dayton, Ohio; that the evening was
    spent very agreeably, except some dissatisfaction on the part
    of certain females with regard to the conduct of Dr. Foster. On
    their return from Washington, witness informed President Smith of
    Foster's conduct. President Smith said he had frequently reproved
    Foster for such conduct, and he had promised to do better, and told
    witness to reprove Foster, if he saw anything out of the way. That
    evening Foster refused to join the company, and walked through
    the town till about 8 o'clock, when he came in and interrupted
    President Smith, who was expounding some passages of the Scripture,
    and changed the conversation. Soon after the company were invited
    to Mr. Brown's at the next door, whither they all repaired. While
    at Mr. Brown's, conversation was going on, and the room much
    crowded. Dr. Foster and one of the ladies he had paid so much
    attention to before took their seats in one corner of the room.
    [Here follows statement of such lewdness in speech and conduct
    on the part of Foster that it would violate propriety to print
    it.] Next morning witness went in while Foster and others were
    at breakfast, and related what he had seen. Foster denied it.
    President Smith told him not to deny it, for he saw it himself, and
    was ashamed of it. Foster confessed it was true, and promised to
    reform.

    Peter Haws sworn. Said that he came to Nauvoo before the Laws and
    brought considerable property. It was a short time after the Church
    had been driven out of Missouri, and had arrived in this place. The
    families having been robbed of all in Missouri, were in a starving
    condition. By the counsel of the Presidency, witness converted
    his funds to feeding the poor, bringing in meat and flour, &c.;
    and while thus engaged, drew upon the Laws, who were at that time
    engaged in {441} merchandise, to the amount of some six hundred
    dollars, which, on account of expenditure for the poor, he was not
    able to pay within seventy or eighty dollars, which they pressed
    him for as soon as they wanted it, although he offered them good
    property at considerable less than the market value, as witness was
    obliged to leave the city on Church business for a little season.
    William Law threatened and intimidated witness' family during his
    absence for the pay.

    Dr. Foster made a public dinner on the 4th of July. Witness was
    obliged to be absent, and deposited meat, flour, &c., with William
    Law to give to the poor at that dinner, and Law handed it out as
    his own private property. Witness carried a load of wheat to Law's
    mill to be ground. Law would not grind it only to give a certain
    quantity of flour in return by weight. Law used up the flour,
    promising from time to time he would refund it. As witness was
    about to start on a mission to the south with his valise in his
    hand saw Law before his door talking with Hyrum Smith. Called on
    Law, and told him he was going away, and his family wanted the
    flour. Law promised on the honor of a gentleman and a Saint, that
    his family should have the flour when they wanted.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith said he recollected the time and circumstance.

    Hawes said when he returned he found his family must have starved,
    if they had not borrowed money to get food somewhere else; could
    not get it of Law; and Law was preaching punctuality,_ punctuality,
    punctuality,_ as the whole drift of his discourses to the Saints,
    and abusing them himself and grinding the poor.

    Mayor said, if he had a City Council who felt as he did, the
    establishment (referring to the _Nauvoo Expositor_) would be
    declared a nuisance before night; and then he read an editorial
    from the _Nauvoo Expositor._ He then asked who ever said a word
    against Judge Emmons until he attacked this Council? or even
    against Joseph H. Jackson or the Laws, until they came out against
    the city? Here is a paper (_Nauvoo Expositor_) that is exciting
    our enemies abroad. Joseph H. Jackson has been proved a murderer
    before the Council, and he declared the paper a nuisance--a greater
    nuisance than a dead carcass. They make it a criminality for a man
    to have a wife on the earth while he has one in heaven, according
    to the keys of the Holy Priesthood; and he then read a statement
    of William Law's from the _Expositor,_ where the truth of God was
    transformed into a lie concerning this thing. He then read several
    statements of Austin Cowles in the _Expositor_ concerning a private
    interview, and said he never had any private conversations with
    Austin Cowles on these subjects; that he preached on the stand from
    the Bible, showing the order in ancient days. What the opposition
    party {442} want is to raise a mob on us and take the spoil from
    us, as they did in Missouri. He said it was as much as he could do
    to keep his clerk, Thompson, from publishing the proceeding of the
    Laws and causing the people to rise up against them. Said he would
    rather die tomorrow and have the thing smashed, than live and have
    it go on, for it was exciting the spirit of mobocracy among the
    people, and bringing death and destruction upon us.

    Peter Hawes recalled a circumstance which he had forgotten to
    mention concerning a Mr. Smith who came from England and soon
    after died. The children had no one to protect them. There was one
    girl sixteen or seventeen years old, and a younger sister. Witness
    took these girls into his family out of pity. Wilson Law, then
    Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion, was familiar with the oldest
    daughter. Witness cautioned the girl. Wilson was soon there again,
    and went out in the evening with the girl, who, when charged by the
    witness' wife, confessed that Wilson Law had seduced her. Witness
    told her he could not keep her. The girl wept, made much ado, and
    many promises. Witness told her if she would do right she might
    stay; but she did not keep her promise. Wilson came again and she
    went out with him. Witness then required her to leave the house.

    Mayor said certain women came to complain to his wife that they had
    caught Wilson Law with the girl [in compromising relations] at Mr.
    Hawes' in the night.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith proceeded to show the falsehood of Austin
    Cowles in the _Expositor,_ in relation to the revelation referred
    to.

    Mayor said he had never preached the revelation in private; but
    he had public. Had not taught to the anointed in the Church in
    private, which statement many present confirmed; that on inquiring
    concerning the passage on the resurrection concerning "they neither
    marry nor are given in marriage," &c., he received for answer, "Man
    in this life must marry in view of eternity, otherwise they must
    remain as angels, or be single in heaven," which was the doctrine
    of the revelation referred to; and the Mayor spoke at considerable
    length in explanation of this principle, and was willing, for
    one, to subscribe his name to declare the _Expositor_ and whole
    establishment a nuisance.

    Two o'clock p.m. Willard Richards, the clerk of the Council, bore
    testimony of the good character and high standing of Mr. Smith and
    his family, whose daughter was seduced by Wilson Law, as stated
    by the last witness before the morning council; that Mrs. Smith
    died near the mouth of the Mississippi, and the father and eldest
    daughter died soon after their arrival in this place; and that the
    seduction of such a youthful, fatherless and innocent creature,
    by such a man in high standing as the Major-General of the Nauvoo
    Legion, was one of the darkest, damnedest, and foulest deeds on
    record.

    {443} Councilor Hyrum Smith concurred in the remarks made by the
    clerk concerning the excellent character of Mr. Smith and his
    family.

    Mayor said the Constitution did not authorize the press to publish
    libels, and proposed that the Council make some provision for
    putting down the _Nauvoo Expositor_.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith called for a prospectus of the _Expositor_.

    Councilor Phelps read article 8, sec. 1, Constitution of Illinois.

    Mayor called for the charter.

    The clerk read the prospectus of the _Nauvoo Expositor_ as follows:

    PROSPECTUS OF THE "NAUVOO EXPOSITOR."

    The _Nauvoo Expositor_ will be issued on Friday of each week, on
    an imperial sheet, with a new press and materials of the best
    quality, and rendered worthy of the patronage of a discerning and
    enlightened public.

    The _Expositor_ will be devoted to a general diffusion of useful
    knowledge, and its columns open for the admission of all courteous
    communications of a religious, moral, social, literary, or
    political character without taking a decided stand in favor of
    either of the great political parties in the country. A part of
    its columns will be devoted to a few primary objects, which the
    publishers deem of vital importance to the public welfare. Their
    particular locality gives them a knowledge of the many_ gross
    abuses exercised under the "pretended" authorities of the Charter
    of the City of Nauvoo,_ by the legislative authorities of said city
    and the _insupportable oppression_ of the _Ministerial powers in
    carrying out the unjust, illegal and unconstitutional ordinances of
    the same._ The publishers therefore deem it a sacred duty they owe
    to their country and their fellow-citizens to advocate through the
    columns of the _Expositor_ THE UNCONDITIONAL REPEAL OF THE NAUVOO
    CITY CHARTER, to restrain and correct the abuses of the UNIT POWER,
    to ward off the iron rod which is held over the devoted heads of
    the citizens of Nauvoo and the surrounding country, to advocate
    unmitigated DISOBEDIENCE TO POLITICAL REVELATIONS, and to censure
    and decry gross moral imperfections wherever found, either in the
    plebeian, patrician or SELF-CONSTITUTED MONARCH--to advocate the
    pure principles of morality, the pure principles of truth, designed
    not to destroy, but to strengthen the mainspring of God's moral
    government--to advocate and exercise the freedom of speech in
    Nauvoo, independent of the ordinances abridging the same--_to give
    free toleration to every man's religious sentiment,_ and sustain
    ALL in worshiping their God according to the monitions of their
    consciences, as guaranteed by the Constitution of our country, and
    to oppose with uncompromising hostility any UNION OF CHURCH AND
    STATE, or any preliminary step tending to the same--to sustain ALL
    _however humble,_ in their equal and constitutional rights, and
    oppose the {444} sacrifice of the liberty, the property and the
    happiness of the MANY, to the _pride_ and _ambition_ of the FEW;
    in a word, to give a full, candid and succinct statement of FACTS
    AS THEY REALLY EXIST IN THE CITY OF NAUVOO _fearless of whose
    particular case the facts may apply_--being governed by the laws of
    editorial courtesy, and the inherent dignity which is inseparable
    from honorable minds, at the same time exercising their own
    judgment in cases of flagrant abuses of moral delinquencies,--to
    use such terms and names as they deem proper, when the object is of
    such high importance that the end will justify the means. In this
    great and indispensable work, we confidently look to an enlightened
    public to aid us in our laudable effort.

    The columns of the _Expositor_ will be open to the discussion
    of all matters of public interest, the production of all
    correspondents, subject to the decision of the editor alone, who
    shall receive or reject at his option. National questions will
    be in place, but no preference given to either of the political
    parties. The editorial department will contain the political news
    of the day, proceedings of Congress, election returns &c. Room will
    be given for articles on agriculture, the mechanic arts, commercial
    transactions, &c.

    The first number of the _Expositor_ will be issued on Friday, the
    7th day of June, 1844. The publishers bind themselves to issue the
    paper weekly for one year, and forward 52 copies to each subscriber
    during the year. Orders should be forwarded as soon as possible,
    that the publishers may know what number of copies to issue.

    The publishers take pleasure in announcing to the public that
    they have engaged the service of Sylvester Emmons, Esq., who will
    have entire charge and supervision of the editorial department.
    From an acquaintance with the dignity of character and literary
    qualifications of this gentleman, they feel assured that the
    _Nauvoo Expositor_ must and will sustain a high and honorable
    reputation.

    All letters and communications must be addressed to Charles A.
    Foster, Nauvoo, Ill., postpaid, in order to insure attention.

    WILLIAM LAW,

    WILSON LAW,

    CHARLES IVINS,

    FRANCIS M. HIGBEE,

    CHAUNCEY L. HIGBEE,

    ROBERT D. FOSTER,

    CHARLES A. FOSTER,

    Publishers.

    Nauvoo, Ill., May 10th, 1844.

    Mayor read the statements of Francis M. Higbee from the
    _Expositor,_ {445} and asked--"Is it not treasonable against
    all chartered rights and privileges, and against the peace and
    happiness of the city?"

    Councilor Hyrum Smith was in favor of declaring the _Expositor_ a
    nuisance.

    Councilor Taylor said no city on earth would bear such slander, and
    he would not bear it, and was decidedly in favor of active measures.

    Mayor made a statement of what William Law said before the City
    Council under oath, that he was a friend to the Mayor, &c.. and
    asked if there were any present who recollected his statement, when
    scores responded, Yes.

    Councilor Taylor continued--Wilson Law was President of this
    Council during the passage of many ordinances, and referred to
    the records. "William Law and Emmons were members of the Council,
    and Emmons has never objected to any ordinance while in the
    Council, but has been more like a cipher, and is now become editor
    of a libelous paper, and is trying to destroy our charter and
    ordinances." He then read from the Constitution of the United
    States on the freedom of the press, and said--"We are willing they
    should publish the truth; but it is unlawful to publish libels. The
    _Expositor_ is a nuisance, and stinks in the nose of every honest
    man."

    Mayor read from Illinois Constitution, article 8, section 22,
    touching the responsibility of the press for its constitutional
    liberty.

    Councilor Stiles said a nuisance was anything that disturbs the
    peace of a community, and read Blackstone on private wrongs, vol.
    2, page 4; and the whole community has to rest under the stigma
    of these falsehoods (referring to the_ Expositor_); and if we
    can prevent the issuing of any more slanderous communications,
    he would go in for it. It is right for this community to show a
    proper resentment; and he would go in for suppressing all further
    publications of the kind.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith believed the best way was to smash the press
    and pi the type.

    Councilor Johnson concurred with the Councilors who had spoken.

    Alderman Bennett referred to the statement of the _Expositor_
    concerning the Municipal Court in the case of Jeremiah Smith as a
    libel, and considered the paper a public nuisance.

    Councilor Warrington considered his a peculiar situation, as he
    did not belong to any church or any party. Thought it might be
    considered rather harsh for the Council to declare the paper a
    nuisance, and proposed giving a few days limitation, and assessing
    a fine of $3,000 for every libel; and if they would not cease
    publishing libels, to declare it a nuisance; and said the statutes
    made provisions for a fine of $500.

    Mayor replied that they threatened to shoot him when at Carthage,
    and the women and others dare not go to Carthage to prosecute; and
    {446} read a libel from the _Expositor_ concerning the imprisonment
    of Jeremiah Smith.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith spoke of the _Warsaw Signal,_ and
    disapprobated its libelous course.

    Mayor remarked he was sorry to have one dissenting voice in
    declaring the _Expositor_ a nuisance.

    Councilor Warrington did not mean to be understood to go against
    the proposition; but would not be in haste in declaring a nuisance.

    Councilor Hyrum Smith referred to the mortgages and property of the
    proprietors of the_ Expositor,_ and thought there would be little
    chance of collecting damages for libels.

    Alderman Elias Smith considered there was but one course to pursue
    that the proprietors were out of the reach of the law; that our
    course was to put an end to the things at once. Believed by what he
    had heard that if the City Council did not do it, others would.

    Councilor Hunter believed it to be a nuisance. Referred to the
    opinion of Judge Pope on _habeas corpus,_ and spoke in favor of
    the charter, &c. Asked Francis M. Higbee, before the jury, if he
    was not the man he saw at Joseph's house making professions of
    friendship. Higbee said he was not. (Hundreds know this statement
    to be false.) He also asked R. D. Foster if he did not state before
    hundreds of people that he believed Joseph to be a Prophet. "No,"
    said Foster. They were under oath when they said it. (Many hundreds
    of people are witness to this perjury).

    Alderman Orson Spencer accorded with the views expressed, that
    the _Nauvoo Expositor_ is a nuisance. Did not consider it wise to
    give them time to trumpet a thousand lies. Their property could
    not pay for it. If we pass only a fine or imprisonment, have we
    any confidence that they will desist? None at all. We have found
    these men covenant-breakers with God, with their wives, &c. Have we
    any hope of their doing better? Their characters have gone before
    them. Shall they be suffered to go on, and bring a mob upon us,
    and murder our women and children, and burn our beautiful city!
    No! I had rather my blood would be spilled at once, and would like
    to have the press removed as soon as the ordinance would allow:
    and wish the matter might be put into the hands of the Mayor, and
    everybody stand by him in the execution of his duties, and hush
    every murmur.

    Councilor Levi Richards said he had felt deeply on this subject,
    and concurred fully in the view General Smith had expressed of
    it this day; thought it unnecessary to repeat what the Council
    perfectly understood; considered private interest as nothing in
    comparison with the public good. Every time a line was formed in
    Far West, he was there--for what? To defend it against just such
    scoundrels and influence {447} as the _Nauvoo Expositor_ and its
    supporters were directly calculated to bring against us again.
    Considered the doings of the Council this day of immense moment,
    not to this city alone, but to the whole world; would go in to put
    a stop to the thing at once. Let it be thrown out of this city, and
    the responsibility of countenancing such a press be taken off our
    shoulders and fall on the State, if corrupt enough to sustain it.

    Councilor Phineas Richards said that he had not forgotten the
    transaction at Haun's Mill, and that he recollected that his
    son George Spencer then lay in the well referred to on the day
    previous, without a winding-sheet, shroud or coffin. He said he
    could not sit still when he saw the same spirit raging in this
    place. He considered the publication of the _Expositor_ as much
    murderous at heart as David was before the death of Uriah; was
    prepared to take stand; by the Mayor, and whatever he proposes;
    would stand by him to the last. The quicker it is stopped the
    better.

    Councilor Phelps had investigated the Constitution, Charter, and
    laws. The power to declare that office a nuisance is granted to
    us in the Springfield Charter, and a resolution declaring it a
    nuisance is all that is required.

    John Birney sworn. Said Francis M. Higbee and Wm. Law declared they
    had commenced their operations, and would carry them out, law or no
    law.

    Stephen Markham sworn. Said that Francis M. Higbee said the
    interest of this city is done the moment a hand is laid on their
    press.

    Councilor Phelps continued, and referred to Wilson Law in
    destroying the character of a child--an orphan child, who had the
    charge of another child.

    Warren Smith sworn. Said F. M. Higbee came to him, and proposed
    to have him go in as a partner in making bogus money. Higbee said
    he would not work for a living; that witness might go in with him
    if he would advance fifty dollars; and showed him (witness) a
    half-dollar which he said was made in his dies.

    Councilor Phelps continued and he felt deeper this day than ever he
    felt before, and wanted to know, by "Yes," if there was any person
    who wanted to avenge the blood of that innocent female who had been
    seduced by the then Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion, Wilson Law;
    when "Yes!" resounded from every quarter of the house. He then
    referred to the tea plot at Boston, and asked if anybody's rights
    were taken away with that transaction; and are we offering, or have
    we offered to take away the rights of anyone these two days? ("No!"
    resounded from every quarter.) He then referred also to Law's
    grinding the poor during the scarcity of grain, while the poor had
    nothing {448} but themselves to grind; and spoke at great length in
    support of active measures to put down iniquity, and suppress the
    spirit of mobocracy.

    Alderman Harris spoke from the chair, and expressed his feelings
    that the press ought to be demolished.

    The following resolution was then read and passed unanimously, with
    the exception of Councilor Warrington:--

    "Resolved, by the City Council of the city of Nauvoo, that the
    printing-office from whence issues the_ Nauvoo Expositor_ is a
    public nuisance and also all of said _Nauvoo Expositors_ which may
    be or exist in said establishment; and the Mayor is instructed to
    cause said printing establishment and papers to be removed without
    delay, in such manner as he shall direct.

    GEORGE W. HARRIS,

    President, _pro tem._

    W. RICHARDS, Recorder.

    The following order was immediately issued by the Mayor:--

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO, ss.

    _To the Marshal of said City, greeting_.

    You are here commanded to destroy the printing press from whence
    issues the _Nauvoo Expositor,_ and pi the type of said printing
    establishment in the street, and burn all the _Expositors_ and
    libelous handbills found in said establishment; and if resistance
    be offered to your execution of this order by the owners or others,
    demolish the house; and if anyone threatens you or the Mayor or the
    officers of the city, arrest those who threaten you, and fail not
    to execute this order without delay, and make due return hereon.

    By order of the City Council,

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

    Marshal's return--"The within-named press and type is destroyed and
    pied according to order, on this 10th day of June, 1844, at about 8
    o'clock p.m.

    HEADQUARTERS, NAUVOO LEGION,

    June 10th, 1844.

    _To Jonathan Dunham, acting Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion_.

    You are hereby commanded to hold the Nauvoo Legion in readiness
    forthwith to execute the city ordinances, and especially to remove
    the printing establishment of the _Nauvoo Expositor;_ and this is
    what you are required to do at sight, under the penalty of the
    laws, provided the Marshal shall require it and need your services.

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    Lieut-General, Nauvoo Legion.

{449} _Tuesday 11.--_Spent the forenoon in council with the brethren at
my house. Went to the office and conversed with my brother Hyrum, Dr.
Richards, George G. Adams, and others.

I issued the following.

    PROCLAMATION.

    By virtue of my office as Mayor of the city of Nauvoo, I do hereby
    strictly enjoin it upon the municipal officers and citizens of
    said city to use all honorable and lawful means in their power to
    assist me in maintaining the public peace and common quiet of said
    city. As attempts have already been made to excite the jealousy
    and prejudice of the people of the surrounding country, by libels
    and slanderous articles upon the citizens and City Council, for
    the purpose of destroying the charter of said city, and for the
    purpose of raising suspicion, wrath, and indignation among a
    certain class of the less honorable portion of mankind, to commit
    acts of violence upon the innocent and unsuspecting, in a certain
    newspaper called the _Nauvoo Expositor,_ recently established
    for such purposes in said city, and which has been destroyed as
    a nuisance, according to the provision of the charter. I further
    call upon every officer, authority, and citizen to be vigilant in
    preventing, by wisdom the promulgation of false statements, libels,
    slanders, or any other malicious or evil-designed concern that may
    be put in operation to excite and ferment the passions of men to
    rebel against the rights and privileges of the city, citizens, or
    laws of the land; to be ready to suppress the gathering of mobs;
    to repel, by gentle means and noble exertion, every foul scheme of
    unprincipled men to disgrace and dishonor the city, or state, or
    any of their legally-constituted authorities; and, finally to keep
    the peace by being cool, considerate, virtuous, unoffending, manly,
    and patriotic, as the true sons of liberty ever have been, and
    honorably maintain the precious boon our illustrious fathers won.

    In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and affixed the seal
    of said corporation at the city of Nauvoo, this 11th day of June,
    1844.

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

I had an interview with Elder G. J. Adams out of doors and then
returned home to dinner.

At 2 p.m. I went into court. Many people were present. I talked an hour
or two on passing events, the mob {450} party, &c., and told the people
I was ready to fight, if the mob compelled me to, for I would not be in
bondage. I asked the assembly if they would stand by me, and they cried
"Yes" from all quarters. I returned home.

The Recorder issued a summons for Sylvester Emmons to attend the City
Council on the second Saturday in July, at 10 a.m. to answer charges
then and there to be preferred against him for slandering the City
Council.

Dr. Richards came to me at my room as I was talking to my brother
Hyrum, Eaton Bonney and others, and read the following letter:

    _Letter: L. W. Hickok to Joseph Smith--Probability of Indictment of
    the Prophet et al, at Springfield_.

    SPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 6th, 1844.

    _General Joseph Smith or Dr. Richards_:

    GENTLEMEN.--I arrived at this place on yesterday, safe and sound,
    in company with Major Smith, who is in good health, and wishes to
    be remembered to you and all his friends.

    I have just learned that T. B. Johnson, the individual who figured
    so large at Nauvoo is about to present the case, or his case,
    before the grand jury at this place. This is to inform you of the
    fact, that you may take the necessary precaution, or do what you
    think advisable in the case. From what I can gather, you are all to
    be indicted who were present in the case according to the law of
    the city of Nauvoo.

    I remain a friend to humanity, "equal rights," and justice to all
    mankind.

    L. W. HICKOK.

    P. S.--I have just learned that Elder Wight is in this place, and
    shall put this in his hands, thinking that he may act with more
    efficiency than the mail.

    I am, &c.,

    L. W. H.

Our communications by mail appear to be cut off, as no part of our
extensive correspondence has come to hand by the U. S. mail for the
last three weeks, and Dr. Hickok seems to be aware of it. Instructed
Dr. Richards to {451} answer Dr. Hickok's letter, and then rode out
with O. P. Rockwell.

I received the following letter:

    _Letter: H. T. Hugins to Joseph Smith--Warning the Prophet of
    Probable Indictment_.

    SPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 6, 1844.

    DEAR SIR.--I have just received information that T. B. Johnson is
    making an effort to procure from the grand jury for the United
    States, now in session at this place, an indictment against the
    members of your Municipal Court for exercising their legal and
    constitutional rights, and discharging their sworn duty in acting
    in the matter of Jeremiah Smith's petition for _habeas corpus._
    I could hardly have supposed that he would succeed, had I not
    been informed that there is no doubt that he will accomplish his
    object. I give you this information that you may be able to act as
    circumstances may require. Mr. Smith has not had a hearing, and
    will not till tomorrow morning.

    Yours truly,

    H. T. HUGINS.

    GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH, Nauvoo.

Elders Jedediah M. Grant and George J. Adams preached at my house in
the evening. Cloudy and cool day.

The captain of the steamer _Osprey_ called this forenoon at the
printing office to see me. I rode with him to his boat, which was
at the upper landing. When I came up, Charles A. Foster called the
passengers to see the meanest man in the world. Mr. Eaton stopped him,
and told the passengers that it was Foster who was the meanest man in
the world. Rollison attempted to draw a pistol, but Eaton silenced him,
and kept them all down.

David Harvey Redfield reported that last evening, while on the hill,
just before the police arrived, Francis M. Higbee said while speaking
of the printing press of the _Nauvoo Expositor,_ if they lay their
hands upon it or break it, they may date their downfall from that very
hour, and in ten days there will not be a Mormon left in Nauvoo. What
they do, they may expect the same in return. Addison Everett also heard
him.

{452} Jason R. Luse reported that Ianthus Rolf said, while the press
was burning that before three weeks the Mansion House would be strung
to the ground, and he would help to do it; and Tallman Rolf said the
city would be strung to the ground within ten day. Moses Leonard also
heard him, Joshua Miller being also present.

Bryant, (merchant of Nauvoo) said before he would see such things, he
would wade to his knees in blood.

It is reported that runners have gone out in all directions to try to
get up a mob; and the mobbers are selling their houses in Nauvoo and
disposing of their property.

PRESIDENT SMITH ARRESTED FOR RIOT IN RELATION TO "EXPOSITOR"
AFFAIR--HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS BEFORE MUNICIPAL COURT--A CALL FROM
ARKANSAS--THE PROPHETS'S DREAMS--MASS MEETING AT WARSAW--LETTERS TO
GOVERNOR FORD ON "EXPOSITOR" AFFAIR.

_Wednesday, June 12, 1844.--_At 10 a.m. in my office.

At half-past one I was arrested by David Bettisworth on the following
writ:

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY, ss.

    _The People of the State of Illinois to all Constables, Sheriffs
    and Coroners of State, Greeting_:

    _Whereas_ complaint hath been made before me, one of the justices
    of the peace within and for the county of Hancock aforesaid, upon
    the oath of Francis M. Higbee of said county, that Joseph Smith,
    Samuel Bennett, John Taylor and William W. Phelps, Hyrum Smith,
    John P. Greene, Stephen Perry, Dimick B. Huntington, Jonathan
    Dunham, Stephen Markham, William Edwards, Jonathan Holmes, Jesse P.
    Harmon, John Lytle, Joseph W. Coolidge, Harvey D. Redfield, Porter
    Rockwell and Levi Richards, of said county did on the 10th day of
    June instant commit a riot at and within the county aforesaid,
    wherein they, with force and violence broke into the office of
    the _Nauvoo Expositor_, and unlawfully and with force burned and
    destroyed the printing press, type and fixtures of the same, being
    the property of William Law, Wilson Law, Charles Ivins, Francis M.
    Higbee, Chauncey L. Higbee, Robert D. Foster, and Charles A. Foster.

    These are therefore to command you forthwith to apprehend the said
    Joseph Smith, Samuel Bennett, John Taylor, William W. Phelps,
    Hyrum Smith, John P. Greene, Stephen Perry, Dimick B. Huntington,
    Jonathan Dunham, Stephen Markham, William Edwards, Jonathan
    Holmes, Jesse P. Harmon, John Lytle, Joseph W. Coolidge, Harvey D.
    Redfield, Porter Rockwell and Levi Richards, and bring them before
    me or some other justice of the peace, to answer the premises, and
    further to be dealt with according to Law.

    {454} Given under my hand and seal at Carthage, in the county
    aforesaid, this 11th day of June. A. D. 1844.

    [Seal]

    THOMAS MORRISON, J. P.

[Sidenote: The Prophet Asserts his Rights Under the Law.]

After the officer got through reading the writ, I referred him to the
clause in the writ--"Before me or some other justice of the peace or
said county," saying, "We are ready to go to trial before Esquire
Johnson or any justice in Nauvoo, according to the requirements of the
writ;" but Bettisworth swore he would be damned but he would carry
them to Carthage before Morrison, who issued the writ and seemed very
wrathy. I asked him if he intended to break the law, for he knew the
privilege of the prisoners, and they should have it. I called upon all
present to witness that I then offered myself (Hyrum did the same) to
go forthwith before the nearest justice of the peace, and also called
upon them to witness whether the officer broke the law or not.

I felt so indignant at his abuse in depriving me of the privilege of
the statute of Illinois in going before "some other justice," that
I determined to take out a writ of _habeas corpus,_ and signed the
following petition:

    _The Prophet's Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS, CITY OF NAUVOO.

    _To the Honorable Municipal Court in and for the said City of
    Nauvoo_:

    Your petitioner, Joseph Smith, respectfully represents that he is
    now under arrest in the said city of Nauvoo.

    That he is in the custody of one David Bettisworth, a constable
    in and for said county of Hancock, who holds your petitioner, as
    he says by virtue of a warrant issued by one Thomas Morrison, an
    acting justice of the peace in and for the said county of Hancock,
    and State of Illinois, which warrant was issued upon the affidavits
    of one Francis M. Higbee, charging your petitioner with being
    guilty of a riot, or of having committed a riot within the county
    aforesaid.

    Your petitioner further represents that the warrant of arrest, by
    virtue of which the said David Bettisworth has made this arrest,
    does not disclose sufficiently clear and explicit the charge they
    have preferred.

    Your petitioner further avers that this proceeding against him has
    {455} been instituted through malice, private pique and corruption.

    Your petitioner further avers that the design and intention of
    the said F. M. Higbee in commencing this prosecution is to commit
    and carry out more easily a conspiracy against the life of your
    petitioner; and that the said Higbee has publicly declared that
    it was his determination to do everything in his power to throw
    your petitioner into the hands of his enemies: and that there is
    a determination upon the part of said Higbee and his unhallowed
    coadjutors to commit an unlawful act, and to set the rights and
    privileges of your petitioner at defiance, and bring down upon his
    head this corrupt and unhallowed prosecution.

    Your petitioner further avers that he is not guilty of the charge
    preferred against him; that he seeks an investigation before an
    impartial tribunal, and fears not the result.

    Your petitioner would therefore ask your honorable body to grant
    him the benefit of the writ of _habeas corpus,_ that this matter
    may be investigated upon legal principles, and that the legal and
    constitutional rights of your petitioner may be determined by your
    honorable body. And your petitioner, as in duty bound, will ever
    pray.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    Subscribed and sworn to this 12th day of June, 1844, before me.

    WILLARD RICHARDS, M. C. C. N.

Whereupon the clerk issued the following:

    _Petition of the Prophet Granted_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS, CITY OF NAUVOO.

    _The People of the State of Illinois to the Marshal of Said City
    Greeting_:

    _Whereas,_ application has been made before the Municipal Court
    of said city, that the body of one Joseph Smith, of the city
    aforesaid, is in the custody of one David Bettisworth, constable of
    the county of Hancock, and State aforesaid.

    These are therefore to command the said David Bettisworth,
    constable as aforesaid, to safely have the body of said Joseph
    Smith, of the city aforesaid, in his custody detained, as it is
    said, together with the day and cause of his caption and detention,
    by whatsoever name the said Joseph Smith may be known or called,
    before the Municipal Court of the said city forthwith, to abide
    such order as the said court shall make in his behalf. And further,
    if the said David Bettisworth, or other person or persons having
    said Joseph Smith of said city of Nauvoo in custody shall refuse
    or neglect to comply with the provisions of this writ, you, the
    marshal of said city, or other person authorized to serve the
    same, are hereby required to arrest the person or persons {456} so
    refusing or neglecting to comply, as aforesaid, and bring him or
    them together with the person or persons in his or their custody,
    forthwith before the Municipal Court aforesaid, to be dealt with
    according to law. And herein fail not, and bring this writ with you.

    Witness, Willard Richards, clerk of the Municipal Court at Nauvoo,
    this 12th day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
    hundred and forty-four.

    [Seal]

    WILLARD RICHARDS,

    Clerk of the Municipal Court of the City of Nauvoo.

At 5 p.m. I appeared before the Municipal Court on the above _habeas
corpus_. The following is a copy of their docket.

    _Hearing on the Expositor affairs Before the Municipal Court of
    Nauvoo--Habeas Corpus Proceedings_.

    Special session, June 12th, 1844, 5 o'clock p.m.

    Present--Alderman N. K. Whitney, Orson Spencer, George W. Harris,
    Gustavus Hills, Elias Smith, and Samuel Bennett, associate
    justices. The Mayor being on trial, George W. Harris was elected
    president _pro tem_.

    John P. Greene, Marshal, made his return on the writ of_ habeas
    corpus;_ "the body of Joseph Smith in court."

    David Bettisworth made his return on the copy of the warrant which
    was attached to the petition as follows:--"I hold the body of
    Joseph Smith by virtue of a writ, of which the within is a copy.
    David Bettisworth, constable."

    7th section of Addenda of City Ordinance read by Councilor George
    P. Styles. Resolution of City Council June 10th, 1844, declaring
    printing establishment of the _Nauvoo Expositor_ a nuisance read.
    Mayor's order to the Marshal to execute the same was also read, and
    Lieut.-General's order of June 10th, 1844, to Major-General Dunham
    to assist the Marshal to destroy said printing establishment.

    Theodore Turley sworn, said that the order of the Marshal was
    executed quietly and peaceably. There was no riot or disturbance,
    no noise, no exultation; the Marshal endeavored to keep peace and
    silence, and the officers did also. The two companies under command
    of Dunham and Markham retired in perfect order; no exultation or
    shouting. Marched in front of the Mansion, and were dismissed.

    J. R. Wakefield confirmed the statements of Theodore Turley: said
    the Marshal stated his authority, and demanded the keys of the
    building, which Higbee denied; and Marshal ordered the door to be
    forced, and the press was broken, and type pied in the street.

    {457} James Jackson, sworn, confirmed the statements of previous
    witnesses; heard no noise on opening the door. Most of the
    confusion he heard was Higbee and his company throwing blackguard
    language to the posse, which they did not regard: saw the whole
    proceedings till they were dismissed; all was done in order.
    Higbee's blackguard language was not answered to at all by the
    ranks. Heard nothing said about shooting. Heard some one damn the
    city authorities. Understood it was Charles Foster. I am a stranger
    in this place.

    John Kay, Robert Clift, Augustus A. Farnham, Joseph A. Kelting,
    Henry G. Sherwood, Augustus Stafford, Cyrus Canfield, John Gleason
    sworn.

    Henry G. Sherwood confirmed the statements of previous witnesses.
    Pullin called for Dr. Foster and the officer commanded silence.
    Francis M. Higbee's threats have been lavish towards General Smith
    and Hyrum for a long time; has threatened injury upon them and the
    property of the Smiths. His conspiracies and threats have not been
    a little.

    Orrin P. Rockwell sworn. Some three or four weeks ago said Francis
    M. Higbee said he would go his death against Joseph and Hyrum
    Smith. Francis said, "I know my course is wrong; but if I stop I
    shall get hell, and if I go on I shall only get hell;" and would
    do what he intended at the risk of his life, and would destroy
    the General if possible. Said the Council had ordered the press
    destroyed and "who lays his hands on the press it is death to
    them." Witness has frequently heard Higbee tell lies about the
    General to injure his character.

    John Hughes, Joseph Dalton, William Clayton and James Goff sworn.
    John Hughes said, Higbee said, "By God, all I want to live for
    is to see this city sunk down to the lowest hell, and by God it
    shall!" This was just previous to the Marshal's arriving on the
    10th. William Clayton said two years ago this June Francis M.
    Higbee confessed he was concerned with John C. Bennett in his
    iniquity, and had a bad disorder: said he knew his character was
    ruined. From time to time since that, witness knew Higbee had been
    threatening General Smith's character and property.

    Leonard Soby heard Higbee threaten to shoot General Smith at
    Rollinson's store, and Higbee said the destinies of this people are
    this day sealed in the archives of heaven, and there shall not be
    left one stone upon another on that temple.

    John P. McEwan: Higbee said, in reference to Joseph Smith,
    "G--d--him, I will shoot him and all that pertains to him; and
    before ten suns shall go over our heads, the Temple, Nauvoo House
    and Mansion shall all be destroyed, and it will be the total
    downfall of this community."

    {458} Cyrus Canfield: Higbee said he would never let things go till
    he had accomplished the downfall of General Smith; that he did not
    value his life to produce the downfall of General Smith.

    Joseph Dalton: Higbee said, if they laid their hands on the press,
    from that hour they might date their downfall; that ten suns should
    not roll over their heads till the city was destroyed.

    Court decided that Joseph Smith had acted under proper authority in
    destroying the establishment of the _Nauvoo Expositor_ on the 10th
    inst.; that his orders were executed in an orderly and judicious
    manner, without noise or tumult; that this was a malicious
    prosecution on the part of Francis M. Higbee; and that said
    Higbee pay the costs of suit, and that Joseph Smith be honorably
    discharged from the accusations and of the writ, and go hence
    without delay.

I received the following letter:

    _Letter: Washington Tucker to President Smith--Asking that Elders
    be Sent to Arkansas_.

    ELDORADO, UNION COUNTY, ARKANSAS, May 4th, 1844.

    _To General Joseph Smith of Nauvoo, Illinois_:

    REVEREND SIR.--Last winter, while in the State of Mississippi, I
    became acquainted with one of your missionaries who was laboring
    at the time in that state. Also at the same time, I had an
    opportunity of perusing some of your sacred books; and from what I
    have been able to learn, as well from reading as from observation,
    I am constrained to be very favorably impressed towards the new
    doctrine. Although to me it certainly appears quite novel, yet I
    cannot do otherwise than believe there is great reality in it;
    so much so, indeed, that I am extremely anxious to become better
    informed on this all important and truly vital matter.

    And, moreover, I am not the only one in this part who is an ardent
    seeker after truth. Indeed, the subject is beginning to produce a
    great deal of inquiry and some excitement in this country. Hundreds
    who never before heard of the new revelation are opening their eyes
    and staring and gaping to know more about it.

    Some few days ago, several emigrants arrived here from Mississippi,
    who speak in the highest terms of the Latter-day Saints. Their
    report has greatly increased the inquiry and excitement previously
    going the rounds in this quarter. I hear a number speak of visiting
    Nauvoo, some of taking their families with them, and so remain
    there. But it is the general wish of a great many here in Union
    county for you to send a minister here immediately to instruct
    us and lead us more fully into {459} the light of this wonderful
    and new revealed religion, and direct us into the true road to
    salvation.

    This is the only subject on which my thoughts dwell both day and
    night; for, indeed, during my waking hours nothing diverts my
    meditation from this absorbing topic, and while asleep I dream of
    nothing else.

    If you please, be so good as to send a laborer among us
    immediately; for indeed the harvest is great, and the laborers
    but few, or none at all, I have not the least doubt but that a
    Latter-day Saint would succeed here as well as the most sanguine
    could promise himself. His labors, I am sure, would be crowned
    with success, and the salvation of many a precious yet perishing
    soul might be rescued from death and prove the rich fruits of the
    missionary's toil.

    The principal denominations here are the Methodists, the Baptists
    and Campbellites. A great many of the people, however, are
    none-professors, the greater majority of whom are quite moral, and
    many of them religiously inclined.

    I shall look for a minister from you within two or three months.
    When he does come, I will see that he is hospitably received and
    entertained.

    Your obedient and humble servant,

    WASHINGTON TUCKER.

To which I wrote the following reply:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Washington Tucker, Promising that an Elder
    Should be Sent_.

    NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, June 12th, 1844.

    SIR.--Your letter, dated May 4th, has reached me, and its contents
    duly considered. A multiplicity of business keeps me from writing
    as freely to correspondents as I could wish; still my heart is
    large enough for all men, and my sensibilities keen enough to have
    compassion for every case when justice, mercy, virtue, or humanity
    require it. Be pleased to accept my thanks for your very kind
    letter; study the Bible, and as many of our books as you can get;
    pray to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ, have faith in the
    promises made to the fathers, and your mind will be guided to the
    truth. An Elder shall be sent as soon as the Twelve can make the
    necessary arrangements.

    In the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,

    I am your obedient servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    WASHINGTON TUCKER, Eldorado, Arkansas.

The editor of the _Neighbor_ writes:

    {460} RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE.

    A knot of base men, to further their wicked and malicious designs
    towards the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to
    bolster up the intents of blacklegs and bogus-makers, and advocate
    the characters of murderers, established a press in this city
    last week, and issued a paper entitled the_ Nauvoo Expositor_.
    The prospectus showed an intention to destroy the charter, and
    the paper was filled with libels and slanderous articles upon the
    citizens and City Council from one end to the other.

    "A burnt child dreads the fire." The Church as a body and
    individually has suffered till "forbearance has ceased to be a
    virtue." The cries and pleadings of men, women and children, with
    the authorities were, "Will you suffer that servile, murderous
    paper to go on and vilify and slander the innocent inhabitants of
    this city, and raise another mob to drive and plunder us again as
    they did in Missouri?" Under these pressing cries and supplications
    of afflicted innocence, and in the character, dignity, and honor
    of the corporate powers of the charter, as granted to the city of
    Springfield, and made and provided as a part of our charter for
    legislative purposes--viz., "to declare what shall be a nuisance
    and to prevent and remove the same." The City Council of Nauvoo
    on Monday, the 10th instant, declared the establishment and
    _Expositor_ a nuisance; and the city marshal, at the head of the
    police, in the evening, took the press, materials and paper into
    the street and burned them.

    And in the name of freemen, and in the name of God, we beseech all
    men who have the spirit of honor in them to cease from persecuting
    us, collectively or individually. Let us enjoy our religion,
    rights and peace like the rest of mankind. Why start presses to
    destroy rights and privileges, and bring upon us mobs to plunder
    and murder? We ask no more than what belongs to us--the rights of
    Americans.

[Sidenote: Further Account of Municipal Court on _Expositor_ Case.]

_Thursday, 13_.--At nine a.m. presided in Municipal Court, which sat in
the Seventies' Hall. Present, William Marks, Newel K. Whitney, George
W. Harris, Gustavus Hills, and Elias Smith, associate justices. Hyrum
Smith, John P. Greene, William W. Phelps, Stephen Markham, Harvey D.
Redfield, John Lytle, Dimick B. Huntington, John Taylor, Levi Richards,
Stephen Perry, Jonathan B. Holmes, Jonathan Dunham, Samuel Bennett and
William W. Edwards were arrested on the complaint of Francis M. Higbee,
before Thomas Morrison, J. P., of {461} Carthage, by David Bettisworth,
constable of Hancock county. They petitioned for and obtained a writ
of _habeas corpus._ I sat as chief-justice; William Marks, Newel K.
Whitney, George W. Harris, Gustavus Hills, and Elias Smith as associate
justices.

Addison Everett and James Jackson gave their testimony under oath, when
they were all honorably discharged from the accusations and arrest, the
court deciding that said Higbee pay the costs; whereupon execution was
issued for the amount.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Dreams on Condition of Apostates in Nauvoo.]

In the evening I attended meeting in the Seventies' Hall. George J.
Adams preached and I made some observations afterwards, and related a
dream which I had a short time since. I thought I was riding out in
my carriage, and my guardian angel was along with me. We went past
the Temple, and had not gone much further before we espied two large
snakes so fast locked together that neither of them had any power. I
inquired of my guide what I was to understand by that. He answered,
"Those snakes represent Dr. Foster and Chauncey L. Higbee. They are
your enemies and desire to destroy you; but you see they are so fast
locked together that they have no power of themselves to hurt you. I
then thought I was riding up Mulholland street, but my guardian angel
was not along with me. On arriving at the prairie, I was overtaken
and seized by William and Wilson Law and others, saying, "Ah! ah! we
have got you at last! We will secure you and put you in a safe place!"
and, without any ceremony dragged me out of my carriage, tied my hands
behind me, and threw me into a deep, dry pit, where I remained in a
perfectly helpless condition, and they went away. While struggling to
get out, I heard Wilson Law screaming for help hard by. I managed to
unloose myself so as to make a spring, when I caught hold of some grass
which grew at the edge of the pit.

{462} I looked out of the pit and saw Wilson Law at a little distances
attacked by ferocious wild beasts, and heard him cry out, "Oh! Brother
Joseph, come and save me!" I replied, "I cannot, for you have put me
into this deep pit." On looking out another way, I saw William Law with
outstretched tongue, blue in the face, and the green poison forced out
of his mouth, caused by the coiling of a large snake around his body.
It had also grabbed him by the arm, a little above the elbow, ready to
devour him. He cried out in the intensity of his agony, "Oh, Brother
Joseph, Brother Joseph, come and save me, or I die!" I also replied to
him, "I cannot, William; I would willingly, but you have tied me and
put me in this pit, and I am powerless to help you or liberate myself."
In a short time after my guide came and said aloud, "Joseph, Joseph,
what are you doing there?" I replied, "My enemies fell upon me, bound
me and threw me in." He then took me by the hand, drew me out of the
pit, set me free, and we went away rejoicing.

[Sidenote: Threat of Carthage Mob against Nauvoo.]

Two of the brethren arrived this evening from Carthage, and said that
about three hundred mobbers were assembled there, with the avowed
intention of coming against Nauvoo; also that Hamilton was paying a
dollar per bushel for corn to feed their animals.

The following was published in the _Warsaw Signal_ office. I insert it
as a specimen of the unparalleled corruption and diabolical falsehood
of which the human race has become capable in this generation:

    MASS MEETING AT WARSAW.

    At a mass meeting of the citizens of Hancock county, convened at
    Carthage on the 13th day of June, 1844 Mr. Knox was appointed
    president, John Doty and Lewis F. Evans, vice-presidents; and
    William Y. Head, secretary.

    Henry Stephens, Esq., presented the following resolutions, passed
    at a meeting of the citizens of Warsaw, and urged the adoption of
    them as the sense of this meeting.

    {463} _Preamble and Resolutions_.

    Whereas information has reached us, about which there can be no
    question, that the authorities of Nauvoo did recently pass an
    ordinance declaring a printing press and newspaper published by the
    opponents of the Prophet a nuisance, and in pursuance thereof did
    direct the Marshal of the city and his adherents to enter by force
    the building from whence the paper was issued, and violently (if
    necessary) to take possession of the press and printing materials,
    and thereafter to burn and destroy the same; and whereas, in
    pursuance of said ordinance, the Marshal and his adherents,
    together with a mob of Mormons, did, after sunset on the evening
    of the 10th instant, violently enter said building in a tumultuous
    manner, burn and destroy the press and other materials found on the
    premises.

    And whereas Hyrum Smith did, in the presence of the City Council
    and the citizens of Nauvoo, offer a reward for the destruction
    of the printing press and materials of the _Warsaw Signal,_ a
    newspaper also opposed to his interests;

    And whereas the liberty of the press is one of the cardinal
    principles of our government, firmly guaranteed by the several
    constitutions of the states, as well as the United States;

    And whereas, Hyrum Smith has within the last week publicly
    threatened the life of one of our valued citizens, Thomas C. Sharp,
    the editor of the_ Signal_;

    Therefore, be it solemnly

    Resolved by the citizens of Warsaw in public meeting assembled,
    that we view the recent ordinance of the city of Nauvoo, and the
    proceedings thereunder as an outrage of an alarming character,
    revolutionary and tyrannical in tendency, and being under color
    of law as calculated to subvert and destroy in the minds of the
    community all reliance on the law.

    Resolved, that as a community we feel anxious, when possible, to
    redress our grievances by legal remedies; but the time has now
    arrived when the law has ceased to be a protection to our lives and
    property. A mob at Nauvoo, under a city ordinance, has violated
    the highest privilege in government; and to seek redress in the
    ordinary mode would be utterly ineffectual.

    Resolved, that the public threat made in the Council of the city,
    not only to destroy our printing-press, but to take the life of
    its editor, is sufficient, in connection with the recent outrage,
    to command the efforts and the services of every good citizen to
    put an immediate stop to the career of the mad prophet and his
    demoniac coadjutors. We must not only defend ourselves from danger,
    but we must resolutely carry the war into the enemy's camp. We do
    therefore declare that we will {464} sustain our press and the
    editor at all hazards; that we will take full vengeance, terrible
    vengeance, should the lives of any of our citizens be lost in
    the effort; that we hold ourselves at all times in readiness to
    co-operate with our fellow-citizens in this state, Missouri and
    Iowa, to exterminate, utterly exterminate the wicked and abominable
    Mormon leaders, the authors of our troubles.

    Resolved, that a committee of five be appointed forthwith to notify
    all persons in our township suspected of being the tools of the
    prophet to leave immediately on pain of instant vengeance. And we
    do recommend the inhabitants of the adjacent townships to do the
    same, hereby pledging ourselves to render all the assistance they
    may require.

    Resolved, that the time, in our opinion, has arrived, when
    the adherents of Smith, as a body, should be driven from the
    surrounding settlements into Nauvoo. That the prophet and his
    miscreant adherents should then he demanded at their hands;
    and, if not surrendered, a war of extermination should be waged
    to the entire destruction, if necessary for our protection, of
    his adherents. And we hereby recommend this resolution to the
    consideration of the several townships, to the Mass Convention
    to be held at Carthage, hereby pledging ourselves to aid to the
    utmost the complete consummation of the object in view, that we may
    thereby be utterly relieved of the alarm, anxiety and trouble to
    which we are now subjected.

    Resolved that every citizen arm himself to be prepared to sustain
    the resolutions herein contained.

    Mr. Roosevelt rose and made a brief but eloquent speech, and called
    upon the citizens throughout the country to render efficient aid
    in carrying out the spirit of the resolutions. Mr. Roosevelt then
    moved a committee of seven be appointed by the chair to draft
    resolutions expressive of our action in future.

    Mr. Catlin moved to amend the motion of Mr. Roosevelt, so that the
    committee should consist of one from each precinct; which motion,
    as amended, was adopted.

    The chair then appointed the following: Col. Levi Williams, Rocky
    Run precinct; Joel Catlin, Augusta; Samuel Williams, Carthage;
    Elisha Worrell, Chili; Captain Maddison, St. Mary's; John M.
    Ferris, Fountain Green; James Rice, Pilot Grove; John Carns, Bear
    Creek; C. L. Higbee, Nauvoo; George Robinson, La Harpe; and George
    Rockwell, Warsaw, were appointed said committee.

    On motion of Mr. Sympson, Walter Bagby, Esq., was requested to
    address the meeting during the absence of the committee. He
    spoke long and eloquently upon the course of our grievances, and
    expressed his belief that the time was now at hand when we were
    individually and collectively called upon to repel the innovations
    upon our liberties, and {465} suggested that points be designated
    as places of encampment at which to rendezvous our forces, that we
    may be ready when called upon for efficient action.

    Dr. Barnes, one of the persons who went with the officers to Nauvoo
    for the purpose of arresting the rioters, having just arrived, came
    into the meeting and reported the result of their proceedings,
    which was, that the persons charged in the writs were duly
    arrested, but taken from the officers' hands on a writ of _habeas
    corpus_ from the Municipal Court, and discharged, and the following
    potent words entered upon the records--_honorably released_.

    On motion of O. C. Skinner, Esq., a vote of thanks was tendered to
    Dr. Barnes for volunteering his services in executing said writs.

    Francis M. Higbee was now loudly called for. He stated his personal
    knowledge of the Mormons from their earliest history--throughout
    their hellish career in Missouri and this state--which has been
    characterized by the darkest and most diabolical deeds which have
    ever disgraced humanity.

    The committee appointed to draft resolutions brought in the
    following report, which, after some considerable discussion, was
    unanimously adopted:

    Whereas, the officer charged with the execution of a writ against
    Joseph Smith and others, for riot in the county of Hancock, which
    said writ said officer has served upon said Smith and others; and
    whereas said Smith and others refuse to obey the mandate of said
    writ; and whereas in the opinion of this meeting, it is impossible
    for said officer so raise a posse of sufficient strength to
    execute said writ; and whereas it is the opinion of this meeting
    that the riot is still progressing and that violence is meditated
    and determined on, it is the opinion of this meeting that the
    circumstances of the case require the interposition of executive
    power. Therefore,

    Resolved, that a deputation of two discreet men be sent to
    Springfield to solicit such interposition.

    2nd, Resolved, that said deputation be furnished with a certified
    copy of the resolution, and be authorized to obtain evidence, by
    affidavits and otherwise, in regard to the violence which has
    already been committed, and is still further meditated.

    Dr. Evans here arose and expressed his wish that the above
    resolutions would not retard our operations, but that we would each
    one arm and equip ourselves forthwith.

    The resolutions passed at Warsaw were again read by Dr. Barnes, and
    passed by acclamation.

    On motion of A. Sympson, Esq., the suggestion of Mr. Bagby, {466}
    appointing places of encampment, was adopted--to wit., Warsaw,
    Carthage, Green Plains, Spilman's landing, Chili and La Harpe.

    On motion, O. C. Skinner and Walter Bagby, Esqs., were appointed a
    committee to bear the resolutions adopted by this meeting to his
    Excellency the Governor, requiring his executive interposition.

    On motion of J. H. Sherman, a central corresponding committee was
    appointed.

    Order that J. H. Sherman, H. T. Wilson, Chauncey Robinson, William
    S. Freeman, Thomas Morrison, F. M. Higbee, Lyman Prentiss, and
    Stephen H. Tyler be said committee,

    On motion of George Rockwell,

    Resolved that constables in the different precincts hold themselves
    in readiness to obey the officer in possession of the writs,
    whenever called upon, in summoning the posse.

    On motion, the meeting adjourned.

_Friday, 14.--_Wrote to Governor Ford as follows:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Governor Ford--Explaining Action of City
    Council in Proceedings in "Expositor" Affairs_.

    NAUVOO, June 14, 1844.

    _His Excellency Thomas Ford_:

    SIR.--I write you this morning, briefly, to inform you of the facts
    relative to the removal of the press and fixtures of the _Nauvoo
    Expositor_ as a nuisance.

    The 8th and 10th instant were spent by the City Council of Nauvoo
    in receiving testimony concerning the character of the _Expositor_,
    and the character and designs of the proprietors.

    In the investigation it appeared evident to the council that
    the proprietors were a set of unprincipled, lawless debauchers,
    counterfeiters, bogus-makers, gamblers, peace-disturbers, and
    that the grand object of said proprietors was to destroy our
    constitutional rights and chartered privileges. To overthrow all
    good and wholesome regulations in society, to strengthen themselves
    against the municipality, to fortify themselves against the Church
    of which I am a member, and destroy all our religious rights and
    privileges by libels, slanders, falsehoods, perjury, &c., and
    sticking at no corruption to accomplish their hellish purposes;
    and that said paper of itself was libelous of the deepest dye, and
    very {467} injurious as a vehicle of defamation, tending to corrupt
    the morals and disturb the peace, tranquility and happiness of the
    whole community, and especially that of Nauvoo.

    After a long and patient investigation, of the _Expositor_ and
    the character and design of its proprietors, the constitution,
    the charter, (see Addenda to Nauvoo Charter from the Springfield
    Charter, sec. 7) and all the best authorities on the subject;
    (See Chitty's Blackstone Bk. iii:v, and n., &c., &c) the City
    Council decided that it was necessary for the "peace, benefit, good
    order and regulations" of said city, "and for the protection of
    property," and for "the happiness and prosperity of the citizens
    of Nauvoo," that said _Expositor_ should be removed, and declaring
    said _Expositor_ a nuisance ordered the Mayor to cause them to be
    removed without delay; which order was committed to the Marshal
    by due process, and by him executed the same day, by removing the
    paper, press and fixtures into the streets and burning the same;
    all which was done without riot, noise, tumult or confusion, as has
    already been proved before the municipality of the city; and the
    particulars of the whole transaction may be expected in our next
    _Nauvoo Neighbor_.

    I send you this hasty sketch that your Excellency may be aware of
    the lying reports that are now being circulated by our enemies
    that there has been a "mob at Nauvoo," and "blood and thunder,"
    and "swearing that two men were killed," &c., &c., as we hear from
    abroad, are false--false as Satan himself could invent, and that
    nothing has been transacted here but what has been in perfect
    accordance with the strictest principles of law and good order on
    the part of the authorities of this city; and if your Excellency is
    not satisfied, and shall not be satisfied after reading the whole
    proceedings which will be forthcoming soon, and shall demand an
    investigation of our municipality before Judge Pope, or any legal
    tribunal at the Capitol, you have only to write your wishes, and we
    will be forthcoming. We will not trouble you to fill a writ or send
    an officer for us.

    I remain, as ever, a friend of truth, good order, and your
    Excellency's humble servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

The following letters were also written:

    _Letter: John M. Bernhisel to Governor Ford--Confirming Correctness
    of the Prophet's Report of "Expositor" Affair_.

    NAUVOO, June 14th, 1844.

    _To His Excellency Governor Ford_:

    SIR.--Though I have not the honor of a personal acquaintance with
    you, I take the liberty of stating to you that I arrived here from
    {468} the city of New York about a year since, where I was engaged
    in the practice of medicine for many years; that General Smith's
    letter to you of this date has been read in my hearing; that the
    statement contained therein in relation to the proceedings of the
    municipal authorities for the removal of the press whence issued
    a scandalous sheet entitled the _Nauvoo Expositor_ are correct,
    having been an eye-and ear-witness of them.

    The whole affair was conducted by the City Marshal and his posse in
    the most quiet and orderly manner, without the least noise, riot or
    tumult; and when the nuisance was abated, they immediately retired
    and were dismissed.

    Having been a boarder in General Smith's family for more than
    nine months, and having therefore had abundant opportunities of
    contemplating his character and observing his conduct, I have
    concluded to give you a few of my "impressions" of him.

    General Joseph Smith is naturally a man of strong mental powers,
    and is possessed of much energy and decision of character, great
    penetration, and a profound knowledge of human nature. He is a man
    of calm judgment, enlarged views, and is eminently distinguished
    by his love of justice. He is kind and obliging, generous and
    benevolent, sociable and cheerful, and is possessed of a mind of a
    contemplative and reactive character. He is honest, frank, fearless
    and independent, and as free from dissimulation as any man to be
    found.

    But it is in the gentle charities of domestic life, as the tender
    and affectionate husband and parent, the warm and sympathizing
    friend, that the prominent traits of his character are revealed,
    and his heart is felt to be keenly alive to the kindest and softest
    emotions of which human nature is susceptible; and I feel assured
    that his family and friends formed one of the greatest consolations
    to him while the vials of wrath were poured upon his head, while
    his footsteps were pursued by malice and envy, and reproach and
    slander were strewn in his path, as well as during numerous and
    cruel persecutions, and severe and protracted sufferings in chains
    and loathsome prisons, for worshiping God according to the dictates
    of his own conscience.

    He is a true lover of his country, and a bright and shining example
    of integrity and moral excellence in all the relations of life.
    As a religious teacher, as well as a man, he is greatly beloved
    by this people. It is almost superfluous to add that the numerous
    ridiculous and scandalous reports in circulation respecting him
    have not the least foundation in truth.

    In haste, I have the honor to be your Excellency's most obedient
    and humble servant,

    JOHN M. BERNHISEL.

    {469} _Letter: Wakefield to Governor Ford--Anent the "Expositor"
    Affair_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, June 14th, 1844.

    _Hon. Governor Ford_:

    Being a stranger in the city of Nauvoo, but fully acquainted with
    the facts as stated in Gen. Smith's letter of June 14th, I assert
    that they are true in every particular, and that the press, in
    the minds of all unprejudiced people, was a nuisance of the worst
    character, and that the authorities acted perfectly proper in
    destroying it; and in accomplishing the act there was no noise,
    tumult or riot. Furthermore, having remained for a few weeks at
    General Smith's house, I think it my duty to state that I have seen
    nothing in his deportment but what is correct in all his domestic
    relations, being a kind husband and an affectionate father; and all
    his affairs, both domestic and official, have not only been free
    from censure, but praiseworthy, and ought to be imitated by every
    one desirous of order and peace.

    Yours, sir, most obediently,

    J. R. WAKEFIELD, M. D.

    _Letter: Sidney Rigdon to Governor Ford--"Expositor" Affair_.

    POST OFFICE, NAUVOO, ILL., June 14 1844.

    _His Excellency, Thomas Ford_:

    DEAR SIR.--I address this letter to your Excellency by the hand of
    Mr. Samuel James, in consequence of the difficulties now existing
    in this county, difficulties in which I have had no concern; and
    fearing as I do, that in the midst of an excitement so great as I
    have understood now exists in this county, (I say understood, for
    it is by report only that I speak) there may be attempts made to
    prejudice your mind to take some measures of a violent character
    that may seriously affect the citizens of this place, and injure
    innocent and unoffending persons, which I am satisfied would grieve
    your Excellency, as well as every other thinking and humane man.

    There have for a length of time difficulties existed between a
    number of the citizens of this place, which kept increasing. One
    of the parties had recourse to the _Warsaw Signal_ as a medium
    through which they communicate their difficulties to the world.
    These productions were inflammatory to a high degree, and the party
    thus assailed charged the matter as libelous and highly abusive.
    To these exposures responses appeared in the papers of this place,
    charging the matter as being false and the authors as defamers and
    slanderers.

    Things continued thus until a paper was established in this place
    called the _Nauvoo Expositor._ The first number of this paper made
    its appearance, and it was inflammatory and abusive to an extreme.
    This {470} raised the excitement to a degree beyond control, and
    threatened serious consequence.

    At this particular juncture all the authorities of the city feeling
    a common interest in the peace and quiet of the place, and fearing
    the worst consequences must follow if something were not done, the
    City Council met and took the matter into consideration, and, after
    deliberating on the subject and examining the charter, came to the
    conclusion to hazard all the consequences of declaring the press a
    nuisance, and accordingly ordered its removal. The city marshal, in
    obedience to this order, went and removed the press and destroyed
    it. This was done without tumult or disorder. When the press was
    destroyed, all returned home, and everything has been perfectly
    quiet ever since.

    Within the last three days warrants have been issued from a
    justice of the peace in Carthage, calling for the bodies of the
    persons who destroyed the press. The officer having the matter in
    charge, refuses the persons a hearing before any other justices
    of the peace than the one issuing the warrants. With this demand
    they refused to comply, as there is a large assembly of persons
    assembled at Carthage making threats of violence; and they say,
    and I have no doubt they verily believe that by going there their
    lives will be in danger; and from the intelligence which I received
    last evening from a person in no way connected with the affair, and
    one of undoubted veracity, I must think so myself. This gentleman
    informs me that he has been in Carthage since Monday last at the
    land sales, and he heard threatenings by the persons assembled
    there that if they could get into Nauvoo they would murder
    indiscriminately, and those who wanted to escape must leave. This
    your Excellency would abhor as I do.

    The citizens of this county who do not reside in Nauvoo, and those
    of other counties, have indeed no interest of a personal kind at
    stake in this matter. There are no persons disturbing them, nor
    going to do so; and this great excitement does savor of something
    else to me than a regard for the laws. Why not let the parties, as
    in all other cases of the kind settle their difficulties as the
    laws of the country in such cases have provided.

    Have the citizens of Nauvoo ever interfered with cases of
    difficulty existing in other parts of the county, held public
    meetings to inflame the public mind in favor of one party, and
    prejudice it against the other party? Most assuredly they have not.
    Why, then, must the citizens of this place be scourged with such
    attempts?

    If the citizens of Hancock want the supremacy of the laws
    maintained let these tumultuous assemblies disperse, and let the
    civil officers, if resisted, do as in other cases--call for aid
    instead of assembling in {471} advance, and then call for persons
    to be brought into their midst as prisoners amidst threats and
    insults.

    From the confidence I have in your Excellency's superior
    intelligence, and sound discretion, I doubt not that your
    Excellency will arrive at just conclusions when the matter is
    submitted to your consideration, as I understand it is about being.

    I can see no need for executive interference in this case, but
    disperse all uncalled for assemblies, and let the laws have their
    regular course, which they can have if these assemblies will
    disperse. If not, I fear the consequences.

    I send this to your Excellency as confidential, as I wish not to
    take any part in the affair, or be known in it.

    With consideration of high regard, I am, dear sir, your
    Excellency's most obedient servant,

    SIDNEY RIGDON.

I read the doings of the City Council to Dr. Wakefield, and gave him a
volume of the _Times and Seasons._ About 4 p.m., I rode out with Dr.
Bernhisel. Pleasant and warm day. Towards night some clouds.

A Mr. Norton was tried before Esq. Aaron Johnson, J. P., on a charge of
firing Foster's printing office, and acquitted.

_Saturday, 15.--_At home. Two brethren came from Lima, and said that
Colonel Levi Williams had demanded the arms belonging to the Mormons in
that neighborhood. They wished my advice on the subject. I told them
that when they gave up their arms, to give up their lives with them as
dearly as possible.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Advice on giving up Arms.]

It is reported that a company of men were constantly training at
Carthage. Mr. John M. Crane, from Warsaw, said that several boxes of
arms had arrived at Warsaw from Quincy. There was some considerable
excitement, but expected they were going to wait the meeting at
Carthage, which was fixed for the middle of next week.

The _Maid of Iowa_ arrived at half-past two p.m., while I was examining
the painting, "Death on the Pale Horse," by Benjamin West, which has
been exhibiting in my reading room for the last three days. The _Maid_
had {472} lost her lighter, which was loaded at the time with corn and
lumber, it having broken in two on a snag in the Iowa river.

This morning Samuel James started for Springfield to carry letters and
papers to Governor Ford concerning the destruction of the _Expositor_
press.

About 7 p.m. I rode out with Orrin P. Rockwell.

I received the following letter:

    _Letter: A. Ladd a Joseph Smith--Wharfage Matter_.

    FORT MADISON, June 15th, 1844.

    _Gen. Joseph Smith_:

    DEAR SIR.--I have been informed that a writ was issued against the
    steam ferry, _New Purchase,_ for wharfage, on Tuesday last, but no
    such writ has been served or shown to me, and I am anxious to learn
    the facts of the case. If it is required, I will pay wharfage with
    the greatest of pleasure; but I would dislike to have cost to pay
    in addition. I expect to visit this place with my boat at least
    once a week during the season. You will confer a favor on me by
    informing me in relation to the ordinance, &c.

    It has been rumored that the _New Purchase_ was employed to convey
    to Nauvoo an armed force to attack the citizens in connection with
    other companies, on account of the late difficulties at your place;
    but it is not true. I assure you that the boat will not be employed
    in any unlawful enterprise, and I further assure you that there is
    no unkind feeling existing in our place against the people of your
    place.

    I remain yours with respect,

    A. LADD.

    Captain of the _New Purchase_.

    GEN. JOSEPH SMITH, Nauvoo, Ill.

CHAPTER XXII.

DISCOURSE OF THE PROPHET--THE GODHEAD--THE MOB UPRISING--ARREST OF
PRESIDENT SMITH, ET AL. OVER THE "EXPOSITOR" AFFAIR--TRIAL BEFORE
ESQUIRE WELLS.

[Sidenote: Conference in Michigan.]

A conference was held at Franklin, Michigan. Present of the Twelve,
Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith; Elder George A. Smith presided.
Nine branches were represented, comprising 170 members, 8 Elders, 5
Priests, 5 Teachers and 3 Deacons. There were ordained 1 High Priest,
9 Elders, 2 Priests, and 1 Deacon, under the hands of Elders Wilford
Woodruff, George A. Smith and Charles C. Rich.

_Sunday, June 16, 1844_.--I preached at the stand at 10 a.m. Before
I closed my remarks it rained severely. The following synopsis was
reported by Elder Thomas Bullock, whom I had transferred from the
duties of clerk of the _Maid of Iowa_ to my office.

    SERMON BY THE PROPHET--THE CHRISTIAN GODHEAD--PLURALITY OF GODS.

    _Meeting in the Grove, east of the Temple, June 16, 1844_.

    Prayer by Bishop Newel K. Whitney.

    Choir sang, "Mortals Awake."

    President Joseph Smith read the 3rd chapter of Revelation, and
    took for his text 1st chapter, 6th verse--"And hath made us kings
    and priests unto God and His Father: to Him be glory and dominion
    forever and ever. Amen."

    It is altogether correct in the translation. Now, you know that of
    late some malicious and corrupt men have sprung up and apostatized
    from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they
    declare that the Prophet believes in a plurality of Gods, and, lo
    and behold! we have discovered a very great secret, they cry--"The
    Prophet says there are many Gods, and this proves that he has
    fallen."

    {474} It has been my intention for a long time to take up this
    subject and lay it clearly before the people, and show what
    my faith is in relation to this interesting matter. I have
    contemplated the saying of Jesus (Luke 17th chapter, 26th
    verse)--"And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in
    the days of the Son of Man." And if it does rain, I'll preach this
    doctrine, for the truth shall be preached.

    I will preach on the plurality of Gods. I have selected this text
    for that express purpose. I wish to declare I have always and in
    all congregations when I have preached on the subject of the Deity,
    it has been the plurality of Gods. It has been preached by the
    Elders for fifteen years.

    I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ
    a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the
    Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit, and these three
    constitute three distinct personages and three Gods. If this is in
    accordance with the New Testament, lo and behold! we have three
    Gods anyhow, and they are plural: and who can contradict it?

    Our text says "And hath made us kings and priests unto God and His
    Father." The Apostles have discovered that there were Gods above,
    for Paul says God was the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. My
    object was to preach the scriptures, and preach the doctrine they
    contain, there being a God above, the Father of our Lord Jesus
    Christ. I am bold to declare I have taught all the strong doctrines
    publicly, and always teach stronger doctrines in public than in
    private.

    John was one of the men, and apostles declare they were made kings
    and priests unto God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It reads
    just so in the Revelation. Hence, the doctrine of a plurality of
    Gods is as prominent in the Bible as any other doctrine. It is
    all over the face of the Bible. It stands beyond the power of
    controversy. A wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein.

    Paul says there are Gods many and Lords many. I want to set it
    forth in a plain and simple manner; but to us there is but one
    God--that is _pertaining to us;_ and he is in all and through all.
    But if Joseph Smith says there are Gods many and Lords many, they
    cry, "Away with him! Crucify him! crucify him!"

    Mankind verily say that the scriptures are with them. Search the
    scriptures, for they testify of things that these apostates would
    gravely pronounce blasphemy. Paul, if Joseph Smith is a blasphemer,
    you are. I say there are Gods many and Lords many, but to us only
    one, and we are to be in subjection to that one, and no man can
    limit the bounds or the eternal existence of eternal time. Hath he
    beheld the eternal world, and is he authorized to say that there is
    only one God? He makes himself a fool if he thinks or says so, and
    there is an end of his {475} career or progress in knowledge. He
    cannot obtain all knowledge, for he has sealed up the gate to it.

    Some say I do not interpret the scripture the same as they do. They
    say it means the heathen's gods. Paul says there are Gods many and
    Lords many; and that makes a plurality of Gods, in spite of the
    whims of all men. Without a revelation, I am not going to give
    them the knowledge of the God of heaven. You know and I testify
    that Paul had no allusion to the heathen gods. I have it from God,
    and get over it if you can. I have a witness of the Holy Ghost,
    and a testimony that Paul had no allusion to the heathen gods in
    the text. I will show from the Hebrew Bible that I am correct, and
    the first word shows a plurality of Gods; and I want the apostates
    and learned men to come here and prove to the contrary, if they
    can. An unlearned boy must give you a little Hebrew_. Berosheit
    baurau Eloheim ait aushamayeen vehau auraits,_ rendered by King
    James' translators, "In the beginning God created the heaven and
    the earth." I want to analyze the word _Berosheit. Rosh,_ the
    head; _Sheit,_ a grammatical termination, The _Baith_ was not
    originally put there when the inspired man wrote it, but it has
    been since added by an old Jew. _Baurau_ signifies to bring forth;
    _Eloheim_ is from the word _Eloi_, God, in the singular number; and
    by adding the word _heim,_ it renders it Gods. It read first, "In
    the beginning the head of the Gods brought forth the Gods," or, as
    others have translated it, "The head of the Gods called the Gods
    together." I want to show a little learning as well as other fools--

  A little learning is a dangerous thing.
  Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring,
  There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
  And drinking largely sobers us up again.

    All this confusion among professed translators is for want of
    drinking another draught.

    The head God organized the heavens and the earth. I defy all
    the world to refute me. In the beginning the heads of the Gods
    organized the heavens and the earth. Now the learned priests and
    the people rage, and the heathen imagine a vain thing. If we pursue
    the Hebrew text further, it reads, _"Berosheit baurau Eloheim ait
    aashamayeen vehau auraits"--_"The head one of the Gods said. Let
    us make a man in our own image." I once asked a learned Jew, "If
    the Hebrew language compels us to render all words ending in _heim_
    in the plural, why not render the first _Eloheim_ plural?" He
    replied, "That is the rule with few exceptions; but in this case
    it would ruin the Bible." He acknowledged I was right. I came here
    to investigate these things precisely as I believe them. Hear and
    judge for yourselves; and if you go away satisfied, well and good.

    {476} In the very beginning the Bible shows there is a plurality
    of Gods beyond the power of refutation. It is a great subject I am
    dwelling on. The word _Eloheim_ ought to be in the plural all the
    way through--Gods. The heads of the Gods appointed one God for us;
    and when you take [that] view of the subject, it sets one free to
    see all the beauty, holiness and perfection of the Gods. All I want
    is to get the simple, naked truth, and the whole truth.

    Many men say there is one God; the Father, the Son and the Holy
    Ghost are only one God! I say that is a strange God anyhow--three
    in one, and one in three! It is a curious organization. "Father, I
    pray not for the world, but I pray for them which thou hast given
    me." "Holy Father, keep through Thine own name those whom thou hast
    given me, that they may be one as we are." All are to be crammed
    into one God, according to sectarianism. It would make the biggest
    God in all the world. He would be a wonderfully big God--he would
    be a giant or a monster. I want to read the text to you myself--"I
    am agreed with the Father and the Father is agreed with me, and
    we are agreed as one." The Greek shows that it should be agreed.
    "Father, I pray for them which Thou hast given me out of the world,
    and not for those alone, but for them also which shall believe
    on me through their word, that they all may be agreed, as Thou,
    Father, art with me, and I with Thee, that they also may be agreed
    with us," and all come to dwell in unity, and in all the glory and
    everlasting burnings of the Gods; and then we shall see as we are
    seen, and be as our God and He as His Father. I want to reason a
    little on this subject. I learned it by translating the papyrus
    which is now in my house. I learned a testimony concerning Abraham,
    and he reasoned concerning the God of heaven. "In order to do
    that," said he, "suppose we have two facts: that supposes another
    fact may exist--two men on the earth, one wiser than the other,
    would logically show that another who is wiser than the wisest may
    exist. Intelligences exist one above another, so that there is no
    end to them."

    If Abraham reasoned thus--If Jesus Christ was the Son of God, and
    John discovered that God the Father of Jesus Christ had a Father,
    you may suppose that He had a Father also. Where was there ever a
    son without a father? And where was there ever a father without
    first being a son? Whenever did a tree or anything spring into
    existence without a progenitor? And everything comes in this way.
    Paul says that which is earthly is in the likeness of that which is
    heavenly, Hence if Jesus had a Father, can we not believe that _He_
    had a Father also? I despise the idea of being scared to death at
    such a doctrine, for the Bible is full of it.

    I want you to pay particular attention to what I am saying. Jesus
    {477} said that the Father wrought precisely in the same way as
    His Father had done before Him. As the Father had done before. He
    laid down His life, and took it up the same as His Father had done
    before. He did as He was sent, to lay down His life and take it up
    again; and then was committed unto Him the keys, &c. I know it is
    good reasoning.

    I have reason to think that the Church is being purged. I saw Satan
    fall from heaven, and the way they ran was a caution. All these are
    wonders and marvels in our eyes in these last days. So long as men
    are under the law of God, they have no fears--they do not scare
    themselves.

    I want to stick to my text, to show that when men open their lips
    against these truths they do not injure me, but injure themselves.
    To the law and to the testimony, for these principles are poured
    out all over the scriptures. When things that are of the greatest
    importance are passed over by weak-minded men without even a
    thought, I want to see truth in all its bearings and hug it to my
    bosom. I believe all that God ever revealed, and I never hear of a
    man being damned for believing too much; but they are damned for
    unbelief.

    They found fault with Jesus Christ because He said He was the Son
    of God, and made Himself equal with God. They say of me, like they
    did of the apostles of old, that I must be put down. What did Jesus
    say? "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are Gods? If He
    called them Gods unto whom the word of God came, and the scriptures
    cannot be broken, say ye of Him whom the Father had sanctified and
    sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said I am the
    Son of God?" It was through Him that they drank of the spiritual
    rock. Of course He would take the honor to Himself. Jesus, if they
    were called Gods unto whom the word of God came, why should it be
    thought blasphemy that I should say I am the son of God?

    Oh, poor, blind apostates! did you never think of this before?
    These are the quotations that the apostates take from the
    scriptures. They swear that they believe the Bible, the Book of
    Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants and then you will get from
    them filth, slander, and bogus-makers plenty. One of the apostate
    Church official members prophesied that Joseph would never preach
    any more, and yet I am now preaching.

    Go and read the vision in the Book of Covenants. There is clearly
    illustrated glory upon glory--one glory of the sun, another glory
    of the moon, and a glory of the stars; and as one star differeth
    from another star in glory, even so do they of the telestial world
    differ in glory, and every man who reigns in celestial glory is a
    God to his dominions. By the apostates admitting the testimony of
    the Doctrine and Covenants, they damn themselves. Paul, what do you
    say? They impeached Paul {478} and all went and left him. Paul had
    seven churches, and they drove him off from among them; and yet
    they cannot do it by me. I rejoice in that. My testimony is good.

    Paul says, "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the
    moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from
    another star in glory. So is also the resurrection of the dead."
    They who obtain a glorious resurrection from the dead, are exalted
    far above principalities, powers, thrones, dominions and angels,
    and are expressly declared to be heirs of God and joint heirs with
    Jesus Christ, all having eternal power.

    The scriptures are a mixture of very strange doctrines to the
    Christian world, who are blindly led by the blind. I will refer
    to another scripture. "Now," says God, when He visited Moses in
    the bush, (Moses was a stammering sort of a boy like me) God said,
    "Thou shalt be a God unto the children of Israel." God said, "Thou
    shalt be a God unto Aaron, and he shall be thy spokesman." I
    believe those Gods that God reveals as Gods to be sons of God, and
    all can cry, "Abba, Father!" Sons of God who exalt themselves to
    be Gods, even from before the foundation of the world, and are the
    only Gods I have a reverence for.

    John said he was a king. "And from Jesus Christ, who is the
    faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the
    Prince of the kings of the earth. Unto Him that loved us, and
    washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings
    and priests unto God, and His Father; to him be glory and dominion
    forever and ever Amen." Oh, Thou God who art King of kings and
    Lord of lords, the sectarian world, by their actions, declare, "We
    cannot believe Thee."

    The old Catholic church traditions are worth more than all you
    have said. Here is a principle of logic that most men have no more
    sense than to adopt. I will illustrate it by an old apple tree.
    Here jumps off a branch and says, I am the true tree, and you
    are corrupt. If the whole tree is corrupt, are not its branches
    corrupt? If the Catholic religion is a false religion, how can
    any true religion come out of it? If the Catholic church is bad,
    how can any good thing come out of it? The character of the old
    churches have always been slandered by all apostates since the
    world began.

    I testify again, as the Lord lives, God never will acknowledge
    any traitors or apostates. Any man who will betray the Catholics
    will betray you; and if he will betray me, he will betray you.
    All men are liars who say they are of the true Church without the
    revelations of Jesus Christ and the Priesthood of Melchisedek,
    which is after the order of the Son of God.

    It is in the order of heavenly things that God should always send
    a {479} new dispensation into the world when men have apostatized
    from the truth and lost the priesthood; but when men come out
    and build upon other men's foundations, they do it on their own
    responsibility, without authority from God; and when the floods
    come and the winds blow, their foundations will be found to be
    sand, and their whole fabric will crumble to dust.

    Did I build on any other man's foundation? I have got all the truth
    which the Christian world possessed, and an independent revelation
    in the bargain, and God will bear me off triumphant. I will drop
    this subject. I wish I could speak for three or four hours; but it
    is not expedient on account of the rain: I would still go on, and
    show you proof upon proofs; all the Bible is equal in support of
    this doctrine, one part as another.

[On account of the rain it was impossible for Thomas Bullock to report
any more].

[Sidenote: Advice of Judge Thomas on _Expositor_ Affair.]

Judge Jesse B. Thomas came to Nauvoo, and advised me to go before some
justice of the peace of the county, and have an examination of the
charges specified in the writ from Justice Morrison of Carthage; and if
acquitted or bound over, it would allay all excitement, answer the law
and cut off all legal pretext for a mob, and he would be bound to order
them to keep the peace.

[Sidenote: Inquiry of Delegation from Madison.]

Some forty gentlemen from Madison came down on a steamer to inquire
into our difficulties. I met them at the Masonic Hall at 2 p.m., and
gave them the desired information. Dr. Richards, the city recorder,
read the minutes of the council declaring the _Nauvoo Expositor_ a
nuisance. They expressed themselves satisfied. I then went to the
Temple stand and met some thousands of the brethren. I instructed them
to keep cool, and prepare their arms for defense of the city, as it
was reported that a mob was collecting in Carthage and other places. I
exhorted them to be quiet and make no disturbance, and instructed the
brethren to organize into the capacity of a public meeting and send
delegates to all the surrounding towns and villages, to explain the
cause of the disturbance, and show {480} them that all was peace at
Nauvoo, and that there was no cause for any mobs.

A messenger arrived stating that the clerk of the county court expected
to be driven out of Carthage tomorrow, and the only way to prevent the
shedding of blood was to get the Governor in person to come down with
his staff.

I wrote to Governor Ford stating the facts as follows:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Governor Ford--Inviting the Governor to
    Nauvoo_.

    NAUVOO, ILLINOIS, June 16th, 1844.

    _His Excellency Thomas Ford_:

    SIR.--I am informed from credible sources, as well as from the
    proceedings of a public meeting at Carthage, &c., as published
    in the _Warsaw Signal_ extra, that an energetic attempt is being
    made by some of the citizens of this and the surrounding counties
    to drive and exterminate "the Saints" by force of arms; and I
    send this information to your Excellency by a special messenger,
    Hugh McFall, Adjutant-General, Nauvoo Legion, who will give
    all particulars; and I ask at your hands immediate counsel and
    protection.

    Judge Thomas has been here and given his advice in the case, which
    I shall strictly follow until I hear from your Excellency, and in
    all cases shall adhere to the Constitution and laws.

    The Nauvoo Legion is at your service to quell all insurrection and
    support the dignity of the common weal.

    I wish, urgently wish your Excellency to come down in person with
    your staff and investigate the whole matter without delay, and
    cause peace to be restored to the country; and I know not but this
    will be the only means of stopping an effusion of blood.

    The information referred to above is before me by affidavit.

    I remain, sir, the friend of peace, and your Excellency's humble
    servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

I enclosed a copy of the following affidavit:

    _Affidavit: Mob Movements_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS, HANCOCK CO.,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss.

    June 16th, 1844. Personally appeared before me Willard Richards,
    clerk of the Municipal Court of the City of Nauvoo, Thomas G.
    Wilson; and after being duly sworn according to law, deposeth and
    saith that during the last evening Robert Johnson, of the county
    aforesaid, told {481} deponent that fifteen hundred Missourians
    would assemble at Warsaw, in said county, on the morning of the
    17th instant; that the arms of the Quincy Greys had been sent up to
    Warsaw; that they had five cannon at Warsaw; that said Missourians,
    and others who would join them, would proceed to Carthage, and the
    Quincy Greys and other companies from Adams county were to meet
    the Missourians in Carthage at the time before stated; that from
    Carthage they were going round to the branches of the Church of
    Latter-day Saints in said county, and inform them that they must
    deny Joseph's being a Prophet, and if they did not deny Joseph,
    they must leave immediately: and on Thursday next the whole mob
    were to proceed to Nauvoo and demand Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and
    the City Council of said city, and if Joseph and Hyrum and the City
    Council were not given up they would blow up the city, and kill and
    exterminate all the inhabitants of said city.

    I have compared the within affidavit with the original, and find it

    Clerk of the Municipal Court, City of Nauvoo.

Brother Butler, from Bear Creek, came in and made affidavit before the
Recorder that fifteen hundred Missourians were to cross the Mississippi
to Warsaw the next Morning, on their way to Carthage.

I received a letter from Father Morley:

    _Letter: Isaac Morley to Joseph Smith--Mob Threats_.

    _President Joseph Smith_:

    SIR.--Believing it to be my duty to inform you of the proceedings
    of a wicked clan against the Saints in this place, I improve this
    opportunity. On yesterday, George Baker, in company with Joseph
    Barber, a Mr. John Banks, Luther Perry and one more, (his name I
    have not got) came to my house. Mr. Baker came to my door and said
    he had {482} some business, and wished to speak with me. I went
    out into my dooryard with him, and he came in company with a Mr.
    Banks and others. They informed me they were a committee appointed
    to inform me and our people that they had three propositions to
    make to us. In the first place, yourself and about seventeen others
    had broken the law and good order of society; that we, the Mormon
    people, must take up arms and proceed with them for your arrest, or
    take our effects and proceed immediately to Nauvoo, otherwise give
    up our arms, and remain quiet until the fuss is over. We have until
    Monday morning next to make up our minds. We have made up our minds
    that we shall not comply with any of these proposals, but stand in
    our own defense. We have no signature from the Governor, or any
    official officer, to accept of such wicked proposals.

    We are informed that the company must be at Col. Williams' tomorrow
    morning at eight o'clock to proceed to Nauvoo.

    I have thought it my duty to inform you of the proceedings here.

    This from your humble servant,

    ISAAC MORLEY.

    June 16th, 1844,

    We certify the above is true.

I sent the following answer by Joseph S. Allen:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Isaac Morley--Instructions on Resisting
    Mob_.

    HEADQUARTERS NAUVOO LEGION, NAUVOO.

    LIEUT.-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

    June 16th, 1844

    _Col. Isaac Morley_:

    SIR.--In reply to yours of this date, you will take special notice
    of the movements of the mob party that is stirring up strife and
    endeavoring to excite rebellion to the government and destroy the
    Saints, and cause all the troops of said Legion in your vicinity to
    be in readiness to act at a moment's warning; and if the mob shall
    fall upon the Saints by force of arms, defend them at every hazard
    unless prudence dictate the retreat of the troops to Nauvoo, in
    which case the mob will not disturb your women and children; and if
    the mob move towards Nauvoo, either come before them or in their
    rear and be ready to co-operate with the main body of the Legion.
    Instruct the companies to keep cool, and let all things be done
    decently and in order.

    Give information by affidavit before a magistrate and special
    messengers {483} to the Governor of what has occurred, and every
    illegal proceeding that shall be had on the subject, without delay.
    Also notify me of the same, and demand instruction and protection
    from the Governor.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    Lieut.-Gen. Nauvoo Legion.

I insert the minutes of a public meeting:

    _Minutes of a Public Meeting at Nauvoo_.

    A public meeting was held in the city of Nauvoo on Sunday evening,
    the 16th inst.

    Mr. John Taylor was unanimously called to the chair, and William
    Clayton appointed clerk.

    The chairman stated briefly the object of the meeting, whereupon it
    was unanimously

    Resolved, that inasmuch as many false reports are being circulated
    through this county by designing characters for the purpose of
    bringing persecution upon the peaceable citizens of this city we
    will use our endeavors to disabuse the public mind, and present a
    true statement of facts before them as speedily as possible.

    Resolved that for the more speedy accomplishment of this object,
    this meeting appoint delegates to go to the different precincts
    throughout the county to lay a true statement of facts before the
    public.

    The following delegates were then appointed;

    To Warsaw precinct, Messrs. Joseph A. Kelting, Hugh McFall and John
    T. Barnett.

    Rocky Run precinct, Messrs. Anson Call, E. Horner, Nicholas Boscow
    and David Evans.

    Carthage precinct, Messrs. Lewis Robinson, Jeremiah Hatch, Jun..
    and Dr. Robinson.

    Lima precinct, Messrs. William Allen, Elam Luddington, and Charles
    Warner.

    La Harpe and Pilot Grove, Messrs. Benjamin Warrington and Hiram
    Kimball.

    Spilman's Landing and Appanoose, Messrs. Elijah R. Swackhammer, and
    Truman Gillett, Jun.

    Perkins.

    McIllwrick.

    On motion, meeting adjourned _sine die_.

    JOHN TAYLOR, President,

    WILLIAM CLAYTON, Secretary.

{484} And I issued the following:

    PROCLAMATION.

    MAYOR'S OFFICE, NAUVOO, June 16th, 1844.

    As there are a number of statements in circulation which have for
    their object the injury of the Latter-day Saints, all of which are
    false and prompted by black-hearted villains, I therefore deem
    it my duty to disabuse the public mind in regard to them, and to
    give a plain statement of facts which have taken place in the
    city within a few days past, and which have brought upon us the
    displeasure of the unprincipled and the uninformed, and seems to
    afford an opportunity to our enemies to unite and arouse themselves
    to mob. And already they have commenced their hellish operations by
    driving a few defenseless "Mormons" from their houses and homes in
    the vicinity of Warsaw and Carthage.

    A short time since a press was started in this city which had for
    its object the destruction of the institutions of the city, both
    civil and religious. Its proprietors are a set of unprincipled
    scoundrels, who attempted in every possible way to defame the
    character of the most virtuous of our community, and change our
    peaceful and prosperous city into a place as evil and polluted
    as their own black hearts. To rid the city of a paper so filthy
    and pestilential as this became the duty of every good citizen
    who loves good order and morality. A complaint was made before
    the City Council, and after a full and impartial investigation it
    was voted (without one dissenting voice) a public nuisance, and
    to be immediately destroyed. The peace and happiness of the place
    demanded it, the virtue of our wives and daughters demanded it, and
    our consciences demanded it at our hands as conservators of the
    public peace.

    That we acted right in this matter we have the assurance of one of
    the ablest expounders of the laws of England, namely, Blackstone,
    the Constitution of the state of Illinois, and our own chartered
    rights.

    If, then, our charter gives us the power to decide what shall be a
    nuisance, and cause it to be removed, where is the offense? What
    law is violated? If, then, no law has been violated, why this
    ridiculous excitement and bandying with lawless ruffians to destroy
    the happiness of a people whose religious motto is "Peace and good
    will toward all men?"

    Our city is infested with a set of blacklegs, counterfeiters and
    debauchers, and that the proprietors of this press were of that
    class the minutes of the Municipal Court fully testify, and in
    ridding our young and flourishing city of such characters we are
    abused by not only villainous demagogues, but by some who from
    their station and influence {485} in society, ought rather to raise
    than repress the standard of human excellence.

    We have no disturbance nor excitement among us, save what is made
    by the thousand-and-one idle rumors afloat in the country. Everyone
    is protected in his person and property, and but few cities of a
    population of twenty thousand people, in the United States, have
    less of dissipation or vice of any kind than the city of Nauvoo.

    Of the correctness of our conduct in this affair, we appeal to
    every high court in the state, and to its ordeal we are willing to
    appear at any time that his Excellency, Governor Ford, shall please
    call us before it. I therefore, in behalf of the Municipal Court of
    Nauvoo, warn the lawless not to be precipitate in any interference
    in our affairs; for, as sure as there is a God in Israel, we shall
    ride triumphant over all oppression.

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

I received a letter from my uncle, John Smith:

    _Letter: John Smith to Joseph Smith--Accompanying Delegation to the
    Prophet_.

    MACEDONIA, ILLINOIS, Sunday, June 16th, 1844.

    _President Smith_:

    DEAR SIR.--We send you Brothers Perkins, two faithful brethren, who
    will give you all the information which is within our knowledge
    of the proceedings of our enemies; and as we have not heard or
    received communication from Nauvoo as regards the course we should
    pursue, we now ask your counsel, and you will please forward per
    Brother Perkins. We should have sought your counsel sooner, only on
    account of high water. Please communicate in writing the course we
    in this part of the country should pursue. The brethren in these
    parts are in good faith, spirits, and health generally, and may be
    relied on.

    Respectfully,

    JOHN SMITH.

    GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH.

_Monday, 17.--_I wrote the following to my uncle, John Smith:

_Letter: Joseph Smith to John Smith--Instructions in Case of Mob
Violence_.

    NAUVOO, June 17th, 1844.

    _Uncle John_:

    DEAR SIR.--The brethren from Ramus arrived here this morning. We were
    glad to see them, and to hear that you were all alive in the midst of
    the ragings of an infatuated and blood-thirsty mob. I write {486} these
    few lines to inform you that we feel determined in this place not to be
    dismayed if hell boils over all at once. We feel to hope for the best,
    and determined to prepare for the worst; and we want this to be your
    motto in common with us, "That we will never ground our arms until we
    give them up by death." Free trade and sailor's rights, protection of
    persons and property, wives and families.

    If a mob annoy you, defend yourselves to the very last; and if they
    fall upon you with a superior force, and you think you are not able to
    compete with them, retreat to Nauvoo. But we hope for better things.
    But remember, if your enemies do fall upon you, be sure and take the
    best and most efficient measures the emergency of the case may require.

    Remember the front and the rear of your enemies, because if they should
    come to Nauvoo to attack it unlawfully and by mob force, a little
    annoyance upon the rear with some bold fellows would be a very good
    thing to weaken the ranks of an enemy.

    It is impossible to give you correct information what to do beforehand;
    but act according to the emergency of the case, but never give up your
    arms, but die first.

    The brethren will give you information of the conversation between us.
    We have sent to the Governor, and are about to send again, and we want
    you to send affidavits and demand the attention of the Governor, and
    request protection at his hand, in common with the rest of us that by
    our continual wearying we may get him to come and investigate the whole
    matter.

    I now conclude with my best wishes, and must refer you to the brethren
    for further information.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

Mayor of the City of Nauvoo, and Lieut.-General of the Nauvoo Legion.

My brother Hyrum wrote the following letter to President Brigham Young.

    _Letter: Hyrum Smith to Brigham Young--Calling Home the Twelve_.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, June 17th, 1844.

    _Dear Brother Brigham Young_:

    There has been for several days a great excitement among the
    inhabitants in the adjoining counties. Mass meetings are held upon
    mass meetings drawing up resolutions to utterly exterminate the
    Saints. The excitement has been gotten up by the Laws, Fosters and
    the Higbees, and they themselves have left the city and are engaged
    in the mob. They have sent their runners into the State of Missouri
    to excite them to murder and bloodshed, and the report is that a
    great many hundreds {487} of them will come over to take an active
    part in murdering the Saints. The excitement is very great indeed.

    It is thought best by myself and others for you to return without
    delay, and the rest of the Twelve, and all the Elders that have
    gone out from this place, and as many more good, faithful men
    as feel disposed to come up with them. Let wisdom be exercised;
    and whatever they do, do it without a noise. You know we are not
    frightened, but think it best to be well prepared and be ready for
    the onset; and if it is extermination, extermination it is, of
    course.

    Communicate to the others of the Twelve with as much speed as
    possible, with perfect stillness and calmness. A word to the wise
    is sufficient; and a little powder, lead and a good rifle can be
    packed in your luggage very easy without creating any suspicion.

    There must be no excuses made, for wisdom says that a strict
    compliance with our request will be for our safety and welfare.

    In haste, I remain yours in the firm bonds of the new and
    everlasting covenant,

    HYRUM SMITH.

    P. S.--Large bodies of armed men, cannon and munitions of war are
    coming on from Missouri in steamboats. These facts are communicated
    to the Governor and President of the United States, and you will
    readily see that we have to prepare for the onset.

    In the bonds of the new and everlasting covenant, I remain yours,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

[Sidenote: Arrest of the Prophet _et. al._ for Destroying the
_Expositor_.]

This morning [17th of June] I was arrested, together with Samuel
Bennett, John Taylor, William W. Phelps, Hyrum Smith, John P. Greene,
Dimick B. Huntington, Jonathan Dunham, Stephen Markham, Jonathan H.
Holmes, Jesse P. Harmon, John Lytle, Joseph W. Coolidge, H. David
Redfield, O. P. Rockwell, and Levi Richards, by Constable Joel S.
Miles, on a writ issued by Daniel H. Wells, on complaint of W. G. Ware,
for a riot on the 10th inst. in destroying the _Nauvoo Expositor_
press. At 2 p.m. we went before Justice Wells at his house; and after a
long and close examination we were discharged. The following is a copy
of the minutes of this trial.

    {488} _Minutes of the Trial of Joseph Smith et al. Before Esquire
    Wells--"Expositor" Affair_.

    FOR THE "NEIGHBOR."

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    COUNTY OF HANCOCK, ss.

    Justice's Court, June 17th, 1844, Daniel H. Wells, Justice of the
    Peace, presiding.

    State of Illinois _v._ Joseph Smith, Samuel Bennett, John Taylor,
    William W. Phelps, Hyrum Smith, John P. Greene, Stephen Perry,
    Dimick B. Huntington, Jonathan Dunham, Stephen Markham, Jonathan H.
    Holmes, Jesse P. Harmon, John Lytle, Joseph W. Coolidge, H. David
    Redfield, Orrin Porter Rockwell and Levi Richards.

    Defendants were brought before the court by Joel S. Miles,
    constable of the county aforesaid, by virtue of a warrant issued
    by the court on complaint of W. G. Ware, for a "riot committed in
    the city of Nauvoo, county aforesaid, on or before the 10th day of
    June, 1844, by forcibly entering a brick building in said city,
    occupied as a printing office and taking therefrom by force, and
    with force of arms, a printing-press, types and paper, together
    with other property, belonging to William Law, Wilson Law, Robert
    D. Foster, Charles A. Foster, Francis M. Higbee, Chauncey L. Higbee
    and Charles Ivins, and breaking in pieces and burning the same in
    the streets."

    George P. Stiles, Esq., appeared as counsel for the defense, and
    Edward Bonny, Esq., for the prosecution.

    W. G. Ware sworn. Said he was present when the City Council passed
    an order for the destruction of the press. Went up to the Temple
    and heard the Marshal read the order of the Mayor. Did not know how
    they got into the building. The press was taken out and destroyed.

    Defendants' counsel objected to witness, stating who voted for the
    passage of the bill in the council and read Burns' definition of a
    riot, and said there could be no accessory.

    Councilor Bonny read from the statute, page 173, and pleaded there
    might be an accessory to a riot. Court decided there might be an
    accessory to any crime either before or after the fact.

    Witness knew some who voted for the order in the City Council.
    Heard Gen. Dunham give orders for the destruction of the press.
    Dunham, Redfield and Richards took an active part in the
    destruction of the press. Did not know all the persons.

    Cross-examined: City Council considered the press a nuisance,
    and ordered it to be abated. Was present at the execution of the
    Mayor's {489} orders. No unnecessary noise. All was done peaceably.
    Saw no disorder. Heard no language by the prisoners calculated to
    disturb the peace.

    Henry O. Norton sworn. Was at the printing office. Heard Marshal
    Greene give orders to open the door. Markham carried out the press
    and type. Recollected Dunham. Could not identify any others. No
    contention between the marshal and Higbee. Marshal asked Charles
    A. Foster for the key, which he refused to give. Heard no threats
    concerning the destruction of the press any time.

    O. F. Moesseur sworn. Saw many of the people gather around the
    printing office. Went over, back, and over again. Could not
    identify any person. Heard no loud talking or noise.

    P. T. Rolfe sworn. Was at work in the printing office last Monday
    night. Chauncey Higbee came in and said the Council was about to
    destroy the press, and took some papers from the desk. Marshal
    Greene came with a company and demanded the key. Foster and Higbee
    forbade him. Door was opened by Lytle, as witness thought. The
    press and fixtures were destroyed, and some paper and a desk
    belonging to Dr. Foster, containing several thousand dollars of
    property, four thousand dollars auditor's warrants, and other
    valuable papers.

    Cross-examined: Did not know the amount of warrants and papers.
    Presumed they were destroyed, Did not know whether they were
    destroyed. Was from the office long enough to have them taken out.
    Said Greene, Dunham, Markham, Holmes, Perry, Edwards and Harmon
    helped to move the press. Never knew anything against Joseph Smith
    personally.

    B. Warrington sworn. Was present at the Council when the bill
    passed to destroy the press.

    Joseph Smith objected to calling in question the doings of the City
    Council, and referred to the proceedings of Congress to show that
    all legislative bodies have a right to speak freely on any subject
    before them, and that Congress is not responsible for a riot
    which might arise on the execution of their order by the Marshal;
    that the execution of such order could not be a riot, but a legal
    transaction; that the doings of the City Council could only be
    called in question by the powers above them, and that a magistrate
    had not that power; that the City Council was not arraigned here
    for trial, but individuals were arraigned for a riot. If the City
    Council had transcended their powers, they were amenable to the
    Supreme Court; and that Judge Thomas had decided that an action
    could not lie if no riot had been committed.

    Councilor Bonny said, if the act was committed under an ordinance
    of the city, they might show it in justification.

    {490} Court decided that the gentlemen arraigned were arraigned in
    their individual capacity, and could not be recognized by the court
    in their official capacity.

    Witness said that all he heard the prisoners say was said as
    councilors.

    Testimony on the prosecution closed.

    Councilor Stiles moved that the prisoners be dismissed for want of
    a case being made out.

    Councilor Bonny read the riot act, and pleaded a case had been made
    out.

    Motion overruled by the Court.

    Dr. Wakefield, Willard Richards and Edward Wingott sworn.

    Dr. J. R. Wakefield, of New York, said he went on the hill after
    the order passed the Council. Saw some portion of the Legion
    collected, walking quietly along as though they were walking to the
    "Dead March in Saul." There was no noise or tumult. Higbee asked
    the Marshal his authority. Marshal stated his authority from the
    Mayor for abating the nuisance. Higbee set them all at defiance.
    Some twelve men were called out, who went up stairs and opened
    the door. Did not know how the door was opened. There was not
    more than one thump. Marshal Greene asked one of the officers if
    anything was destroyed except what belonged to the press? and the
    officer replied, "No." All was done in perfect order--as peaceably
    as people move on a Sunday. Was present all the time. All that was
    done was done in their official capacity as officers of the city.

    Councilor Bonny objected to the testimony, as it was not before the
    Court that there was any city.

    Court decided that any knowledge in possession of the Court was
    testimony in the Court.

    E. Wingott, of Boston, concurred in Dr. Wakefield's statements.
    Was by the door when it was opened, and knew that nothing more
    than a knee was put against it. All was done quietly. Was present
    in the City Council when the order passed. Nothing said in Council
    except what was said in capacity of councilors and aldermen. Was
    by the door all the time when the press and type and things used
    in connection with the press were destroyed. There was no other
    property taken from the building.

    Cross-examined: Did not know the name of the man who opened the
    door. Knew Orrin P. Rockwell.

    Willard Richards read the resolutions of the City Council of the
    10th instant, declaring the press a nuisance, &c., and the Mayor's
    order to the Marshal to destroy the press, and the Lieut.-General's
    order to Major-General Dunham to assist the Marshal with the
    Legion, if needed, {491} to abate the nuisance, and the Marshal's
    return that the press and type were destroyed (as published in the
    _Neighbor_, June 19).

    Court queried about the destruction of the desk.

    Dr. Wakefield was again called up. Heard Marshal tell the officers
    and men to hurt no property, except the press, type and fixtures:
    and after the abatement, Marshal inquired if his order had been
    obeyed, and the officers said it had.

    E. Wingott called again. Heard Mr. Foster ask Higbee for the key of
    the office, and afterward saw him deliver the key to Mr. Higbee.
    There was nothing destroyed but what pertained to the press.

    Addison Everett of New York, sworn. Saw the press and type taken
    out and burned. Saw no other property burned. Desk might have been
    taken away before. Should not have seen it, if it had been. Saw no
    desk burned. Does not believe any desk was burned.

    Joel S. Miles sworn. Foster said his docket was not burned. Witness
    was sure that Dr. Foster said he had taken other papers out of the
    desk.

    W. G. Ware called again. Saw Charles Foster coming from the office
    and go into Foster's house with books under his arm. Looked like
    account books. Saw nothing but the press and fixtures brought out,
    except a chair, and the Marshal ordered it to be carried back.

    E. Wingott recalled. Stood close by the door. Could see all that
    was done. Did not believe a desk could be brought out and he not
    see it.

    Dr. Wakefield recalled. Joseph Smith and Hyrum were not on the hill
    at all that evening.

    Joseph W. Coolidge was discharged by the Court and sworn. Charles
    Foster asked Francis Higbee for the key to the office. Higbee
    hesitated. Foster said he wanted to get a desk that had some
    valuable papers in it. Foster got the key and went in. Did not see
    him remove the desk. Might have removed it, and witness not see it.
    There was no desk burned.

    The councilors submitted the case without plea, and the court
    discharged the prisoners.

"Brother Hunter, you have always wished you had been with us from the
commencement. If you will go to Springfield and do this business for
me now in this time of danger, it shall be as though you had been in
Missouri and had always been with us."

Stephen Markham made the following affidavit:

    make an attack upon this city and citizens of Nauvoo, and having
    directed the Marshal to keep the peace, you are hereby commanded to

    in keeping the peace, and doing whatever may be necessary to

I advised my brother Hyrum not to mail his letter to President Young at
present.

I directed my clerk, Thomas Bullock, to remain in the Masonic Hall and
take affidavits of the men who are constantly coming in with news of
the movements of the mob and preserve copies to forward to the Governor.

I received the following letter:

    _Letter: H. T. Hugins to Joseph Smith--Probable Indictment of the
    Prophet at Springfield_.

    BURLINGTON, IOWA TERRITORY,

    June 17th, 1844.

    DEAR SIR.--I write to inform you that Jeremiah Smith arrived here
    yesterday in safety and free from arrest. He desires, through me,
    to thank you for your kindness and attention to him while at Nauvoo.

    I wrote from Springfield to apprise you that an effort was making
    to procure an indictment against the members of your Municipal
    Court for the part they acted in trying the _habeas corpus_
    petitions. Through the efforts of myself and Dr. Hickock, that
    result was prevented, and T. B. Johnson exposed. The boat is
    casting off, and I must close. Dr. Dunlop will write to apprise you
    of the William and Wilson Law's proceedings here. You will hear
    from me again soon.

    Yours truly,

    H. T. HUGINS.

    GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH, Nauvoo, Ill.

The mob is still increasing in numbers at Carthage and other places.

{495} It is reported that William and Wilson Law have laid a plan
to burn the printing office of the _Nauvoo Neighbor_ this night. I
therefore stationed a strong police round the premises and throughout
the city.

The captain of the steamer _Osprey_ called upon me.

[Sidenote: Charge of Threats Against Foster's Life.]

About 11 p.m. a negro came into my office with an open letter, without
any date or name, and said that Dr. Foster gave it to him at Madison
to give Henry O. Norton. In that letter Foster said that Dunham and
Richards swore in my presence that they would kill him (Foster) in two
days, and that there was a man in Madison would swear he had heard them
say so at my house.

I closed the issuing of orders about 12 at night, ready to retire to
rest. Pleasant weather.

To refute the lying slanders of the _Warsaw Signal,_ as published in
the proceedings of a meeting held at Carthage an the 13th instant, I
insert the following certificate. [1]

    TO THE PUBLIC.

    We, whose names are undersigned, having seen in the _Warsaw
    Signal,_ containing the proceedings of a meeting held at Carthage
    on the 13th instant, many statements calculated to arouse the
    indignation and wrath of the people against the citizens of Nauvoo,
    do certify that Hyrum Smith did not make any threats, nor offer any
    reward against the _Signal_ or its editor in the City Council.

    NAUVOO, June 17, 1844.

{496} A _Nauvoo Neighbor_ extra was issued with the following editorial:

    TO THE PUBLIC.

    As a soft breeze on a hot day mellows the air, so does the simple
    truth calm the feelings of the irritated; and so we proceed to give
    the proceedings of the City Council relating to the removal of the
    _Nauvoo Expositor_ as a nuisance. We have been robbed, mobbed and
    plundered with impunity some two or three times; and as every heart
    is more apt to know its own sorrows, the people of Nauvoo had ample
    reason, when such characters as the proprietors and abettors of
    the _Nauvoo Expositor_ proved to be before the City Council, to be
    alarmed for their safety.

    The men who got up the press were constantly engaged in resisting
    the authority or threatening something. If they were fined, an
    appeal was taken, but the slander went on; and when the paper came,
    the course and the plan to destroy the city was marked out. The
    destruction of the city charter and the ruin of the Saints was the
    all-commanding topic.

    Our lives, our city, our charter and our characters are just as
    sacred, just as dear, and just as good as other people's; and while
    no friendly arm has been extended from the demolition of our press
    in Jackson county, Missouri, without law, to this present day, the
    City Council with all the law of nuisance, from Blackstone down to
    the Springfield charter, knowing that if they exceeded the law of
    the land a higher court could regulate the proceedings, abated the
    _Nauvoo Expositor_.

    The proceedings of the Council show, as sketched out, that there
    was cause for alarm. The people, when they reflect, will at once
    say that the feelings and rights of men ought to be respected.
    All persons otherwise, who, without recourse to justice, mercy or
    humanity, come out with inflammatory publications, destructive
    resolutions, or more especially extermination, show a want of
    feeling a want of respect and a want of religious toleration that
    honorable men will deprecate among Americans as they would the
    pestilence, famine, or horrors of war. It cannot be that the people
    are so lost to virtue as to coolly go to murdering men, women and
    children. No; candor and common sense forbid it!

Dr. Richards and Thomas Bullock sat up all last night writing the
proceedings of the City Council for the press.

_Tuesday, 18.--_At 8 a.m. the Legion assembled according to orders, and
organized at 9 a.m., under Acting Major-General Jonathan Dunham. The
first cohort under the command of Colonel Stephen Markham, acting {497}
Brigadier-General, and the second cohort under Colonel Hosea Stout,
acting Brigadier-General.

Just before, I was informed that there were several boxes of arms
landed at the upper stone house, which were secured by the Marshal.
Soon after it was discovered that the arms (40 stand) had been sent by
Henry G. Sherwood, and the Marshal bought them for the city.

About 1:45 p.m. I proclaimed the city under martial law, and caused the
following orders to be issued from the Mayor's office:

    DECLARATION OF MARTIAL LAW.

    PROCLAMATION.

    MAYOR'S OFFICE, CITY OF NAUVOO,

    June 18th, 1844.

    _To the Marshal or the City of Nauvoo_:

    From the newspapers around us, and the current reports as brought
    in from the surrounding country, I have good reason to fear that a
    mob is organizing to come upon this city, and plunder and destroy
    said city, as well as murder the citizens; and by virtue of the
    authority vested in me as Mayor, and to preserve the city and the
    lives of the citizens, I do hereby declare the said city, within
    the limits of its incorporation, under martial law. The officers,
    therefore, of the Nauvoo Legion, the police as well as all others,
    will strictly see that no persons or property pass in or out of the
    city without due orders.

    JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

About 2 p.m. the Legion was drawn up in the street close by the
Mansion. I stood in full uniform on the top of the frame of a building.

Judge Phelps read the _Warsaw Signal_ extra of the 17th, wherein all
the "old citizens" were called upon to assist the mob in exterminating
the leaders of the Saints and driving away the people.

I addressed the Legion for about an hour and a half.

[The following synopsis of this address was compiled by George A.
Smith, from the verbal reports of Joseph G. Hovey, William G. Sterrett,
Robert Campbell and many others who heard the Prophet on the occasion]:

{498}

    _The Last Speech of President Smith to the Legion_.

    It is thought by some that our enemies would be satisfied with my
    destruction; but I tell you that as soon as they have shed my blood
    they will thirst for the blood of every man in whose heart dwells
    a single spark of the spirit of the fullness of the Gospel. The
    opposition of these men is moved by the spirit of the adversary of
    all righteousness. It is not only to destroy me, but every man and
    woman who dares believe the doctrines that God hath inspired me to
    teach to this generation.

    We have never violated the laws of our country. We have every
    right to live under their protection, and are entitled to all the
    privileges guaranteed by our state and national constitutions. We
    have turned the barren, bleak prairies and swamps of this state
    into beautiful towns, farms and cities by our industry; and the
    men who seek our destruction and cry thief, treason, riot, &c.,
    are those who themselves violate the laws, steal and plunder from
    their neighbors, and seek to destroy the innocent, heralding forth
    lies to screen themselves from the just punishment of their crimes
    by bringing destruction upon this innocent people. I call God,
    angels and all men to witness that we are innocent of the charges
    which are heralded forth through the public prints against us by
    our enemies; and while they assemble together in unlawful mobs to
    take away our rights and destroy our lives, they think to shield
    themselves under the refuge of lies which they have thus wickedly
    fabricated.

    We have forwarded a particular account of all our doings to the
    Governor. We are ready to obey his commands, and we expect that
    protection at his hands which we know to be our just due.

    We have taken the counsel of Judge Thomas, and have been tried
    before a civil magistrate on the charge of riot--not that the law
    required it, but because the Judge advised it as a precautionary
    measure, to allay all possible pretext for excitement. We were
    legally acquitted by Esq. Wells, who is a good judge of law. Had
    we been before the Circuit, the Supreme, or any other court of law
    in the state or nation, we would have been acquitted, for we have
    broken no law.

    Constable Bettisworth came here with a writ requiring us to go
    before Mr. Morrison, "or some other justice of the peace of the
    county," to answer to the charge of riot. We acknowledged ourselves
    his prisoners, and were ready to go before any magistrate in any
    precinct in this part of the county, or anywhere else where our
    lives could be protected from the mob who have published the
    resolutions for our extermination which you have just heard read.
    This is a privilege the law guarantees to us, and which the writ
    itself allows. He broke the law and refused us this privilege,
    declaring that we should go before Morrison {499} in Carthage, and
    no one else, when he knew that a numerous mob was collected there
    who are publicly pledged to destroy our lives.

    It was under these circumstances that we availed ourselves of the
    legal right of the ancient, high, and constitutional privilege of
    the writ of_ habeas corpus,_ and were brought before the Municipal
    Court of this city and discharged from the illegal detention under
    which we were held by Constable Bettisworth. All mob-men, priests,
    thieves, and bogus makers, apostates and adulterers, who combine to
    destroy this people, now raise the hue and cry throughout the state
    that we resist the law, in order to raise a pretext for calling
    together thousands more of infuriated mob-men to murder, destroy,
    plunder and ravish the innocent.

    We are American citizens. We live upon a soil for the liberties of
    which our fathers periled their lives and spilt their blood upon
    the battlefield. Those rights so dearly purchased, shall not be
    disgracefully trodden under foot by lawless marauders without at
    least a noble effort on our part to sustain our liberties.

    Will you all stand by me to the death, and sustain at the peril
    of your lives, the laws of our country, and the liberties and
    privileges which our fathers have transmitted unto us, sealed with
    their sacred blood? ("Aye!" shouted thousands.) He then said,
    "It is well. If you had not done it, I would have gone out there
    (pointing to the west) and would have raised up a mightier people."

    I call upon all men, from Maine to the Rocky Mountains, and from
    Mexico to British America, whose hearts thrill with horror to
    behold the rights of freemen trampled under foot, to come to the
    deliverance of this people from the hand of oppression, cruelty,
    anarchy and misrule to which they have long been made subject.
    Come, all ye lovers of liberty, break the oppressor's rod, loose
    the iron grasp of mobocracy, and bring to condign punishment all
    those who trample under foot the glorious Constitution and the
    people's rights. [Drawing his sword, and presenting it to heaven,
    he said] I call God and angels to witness that I have unsheathed my
    sword with a firm and unalterable determination that this people
    shall have their legal rights, and be protected from mob violence,
    or my blood shall be spilt upon the ground like water, and my body
    consigned to the silent tomb. While I live, I will never tamely
    submit to the dominion of cursed mobocracy. I would welcome death
    rather than submit to this oppression; and it would be sweet, oh,
    sweet, to rest in the grave rather than submit to this oppression,
    agitation, annoyance, confusion, and alarm upon alarm, any longer.

    I call upon all friends of truth and liberty to come to our
    assistance; and may the thunders of the Almighty and the forked
    lightnings of heaven and pestilence, and war and bloodshed come
    down on those ungodly {500} men who seek to destroy my life and the
    lives of this innocent people.

    I do not regard my own life. I am ready to be offered a sacrifice
    for this people; for what can our enemies do? Only kill the body,
    and their power is then at an end. Stand firm, my friends; never
    flinch. Do not seek to save your lives, for he that is afraid to
    die for the truth, will lose eternal life. Hold out to the end,
    and we shall be resurrected and become like Gods, and reign in
    celestial kingdoms, principalities, and eternal dominions, while
    this cursed mob will sink to hell, the portion of all those who
    shed innocent blood.

    God has tried you. You are a good people; therefore I love you
    with all my heart. Greater love hath no man than that he should
    lay down his life for his friends. You have stood by me in the
    hour of trouble, and I am willing to sacrifice my life for your
    preservation.

    May the Lord God of Israel bless you for ever and ever. I say it
    in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, and in the authority of the Holy
    Priesthood, which He hath conferred upon me.

    (The people said "Amen.")

Hyrum said that the statement of Sharp in the _Warsaw Signal,_ that he
(Hyrum) had threatened to take his life, was false as hell--there was
not a syllable of truth in it.

About 3:15 p.m., I took the command, and with my staff rode in front of
the Legion, marched up Main Street, and returned to our former parade
ground. The number on parade was very large, considering the number
of Elders who had been sent on missions. After dismissing the Legion
to their several commands, I returned home and gave orders to the
several commanders only to receive official communications through my
aides-de-camp, the proper official channel. I appointed Edward Bonney
one of my aids-de-camp.

Truman Gillett, Jr., made the following affidavit:

    _Affidavit: Truman Gillett--the Treachery of William Law_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO, ss.

    June 18th, 1844.--Personally appeared Truman Gillett, Jr., before
    me, Willard Richards, recorder of the city of Nauvoo; and after
    being duly sworn, deposeth and saith that on or about the first day
    of June, 1842, while passing up the Ohio river on the steamboat
    _Massachusetts_, {501} deponent overheard two men, one a resident of
    Missouri and the other of Ohio, as reported, conversing together
    concerning incidents on the Upper Mississippi, when one said to the
    other. "If Law could have succeeded in getting an introduction for
    us to Joe Smith, damn him, we would have gagged him and nabbed him;
    and, damn him, all hell could not have rescued him from our hands."

    The next morning deponent got in conversation with the man before
    mentioned from Missouri, who stated that he had been on the Upper
    Mississippi on business; that he stopped at Nauvoo on his way down
    with some twelve or fourteen other men, who laid a plan to kidnap
    Joe Smith; that some of the company queried about getting access
    to him, but one of them said he knew they could if he could find
    William Law. They called on William Law in the evening to get an
    introduction to their great Prophet, and Law went with them to the
    gate, where they were stopped by the police; "and it was well for
    him that we did not succeed in getting an introduction to him."

    Deponent said, "Did William Law know your business?" And he said
    "Yes." Deponent asked, "What have you against Joseph Smith? Did he
    ever injure you?" The man replied, "No, but he has others." "Did
    you ever see him?" "Yes. I was one who helped to run the Mormons
    from Missouri," and related many circumstances concerning the
    Missouri mob.

    Deponent said to the man, he was acquainted with William Law;
    considered he was an honorable man, and was led to doubt his being
    engaged with them in a conspiracy against Joseph Smith. He replied,
    "G--d d--n you, it is true, whether you believe it or not," and
    repeatedly affirmed it. Deponent did not believe the statements of
    the man from Missouri as mentioned above until after hearing the
    recent developments before the City Council.

    SIR.--I received your communication from Burlington per Captain
    Anderson; also Dr. Hickock's from Springfield; and feel grateful
    for your favors, and congratulate you and Mr. Smith also.

    The enemy, or mob, is prowling in the southern and eastern part of
    {502} the county, and threatening us with extermination; and we ask
    the friends of peace and good government everywhere to use their
    influence in suppressing the spirit of mobocracy, and sustain us in
    our righteous course.

    So far as you can conscientiously speak in our behalf, and lend
    your influence in our favor for the public good your favors will be
    highly appreciated.

    you think proper. Also request Mr. Dunlop to direct his letter to
    me.

    The bearer, Dr. Wakefield, will give you all particulars.

    In haste, I remain your friend, respectfully,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

I sent the letter by Dr. Wakefield to Burlington.

[Sidenote: Governor Ford's Treatment of the Mob.]

Nine messengers arrived from Carthage, and report that the mob had
received intelligence from the Governor, who would take no notice of
them; and they damned the Governor as being as bad as Joe Smith. They
did not care for him, and they were just as willing he would not help
them as if he would.

There was a body of armed men in Carthage, and a mob meeting at
Fountain Green, which attracted considerable attention.

[Sidenote: Threat Against the Prophet's Life.]

Shadrach Roundy, a policeman, reported at 10 p.m., after I had retired,
that a man by the name of Norton had threatened to shoot me. An
examination was immediately had, but no proof was found.

This evening I appointed Theodore Turley Armorer-General of The Legion.

I insert the following affidavit:

    HANCOCK COUNTY, June 18, 1844.

    Personally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson, a justice of the
    peace, Cyrus Canfield and Gilbert Belknap, of Hancock county; and
    being duly sworn depose and say that on yesterday, June 17th, 1844,
    {503} certain persons--to-wit, Dr. Barnes and Joseph H. Jackson,
    having entered into conversation with your deponents, among
    other things declared that the Governor of Illinois was as big a
    scoundrel as Joseph Smith, and that he is the d--dest scoundrel
    that was ever suffered to live; that they did not care for the
    Governor, and had rather that the Governor would side with Smith;
    that they (the mob) were coming to Nauvoo with a sufficient force
    to take Smith; and if the people endeavored to prevent them, they
    should kill the people; and that if Smith had left Nauvoo, they
    had determined to destroy the Mansion and other buildings. And
    your deponents further say that one John Eller declared that he
    had lived in Missouri and was at the massacre of the Mormons at
    Haun's Mill, that he had killed one Mormon, and that he had left
    Missouri on purpose to fight the Mormons, and would hunt a Mormon
    as he would a deer. And your deponents further say that they heard
    that about one hundred persons had already arrived from Missouri,
    and were expecting as many more from that State. And your deponents
    further say, that they heard in Carthage that they had already
    received a number of guns and ammunition and provisions from St.
    Louis, in order to prosecute their attack upon Nauvoo. And, further
    your deponents say not.

CHAPTER XXIV.

ATTEMPTS TO DRAFT SAINTS INTO MOB SERVICE AGAINST NAUVOO--THREATENED
INVASION FROM MISSOURI--JAMES A. BENNETT URGED TO COME TO NAUVOO.

_Wednesday, June 19, 1844.--_The Legion assembled on the parade-ground.
A company of the Legion came in from Green Plains about 11 a.m. I met
them at the front of the Mansion, and an escort came down from the
parade-ground below the Temple and escorted them to the ground.

At 1 p.m. a company of volunteers arrived from Iowa and were also
escorted to the parade-ground.

[Sidenote: Effort to Draft Chester Loveland into Mob Service.]

On Sunday, the 16th, a committee of the mob, headed by James Charles,
a constable of Hancock county, went to the house of Captain Chester
Loveland, who lives four miles southeast of Warsaw, and required him to
call out his company to join the _posse_ of David Bettisworth to go to
Nauvoo and arrest me and the City Council. He peremptorily refused to
comply with their request. The same _posse_ returned on the 17th with
an order, as they stated, from the Governor, which Loveland believed
(and no doubt correctly) to be a forgery, and therefore still refused
to go on any terms. The _posse_ then reported his refusal to Colonel
Williams, who appointed a committee of twelve to lynch, tar and feather
Captain Loveland on the 18th; which committee went that evening and
arrived about midnight.

Loveland, who had been informed of Williams' order, prepared himself
for defense and kept watch. As soon as they came and he saw their
number, and that they were {505} provided with tar bucket, bag of
feathers and a bundle of withes, in addition to their fire-arms, he
blew out his light and placed himself in a suitable position to defend
the door (which he had fastened) and the window. They went around his
house several times, tried his door, rapped, called him by name, and
consulted together. Some were for breaking the door; others thought
it too dangerous. They knew he must be in there, for they were near
his door when the light was blown out. Finally their courage failed;
and notifying him to leave the country immediately, they took their
departure. During this trying time Loveland did not speak.

[Sidenote: Roads Leading into Nauvoo Picketed.]

In the afternoon I gave orders to General Dunham to have a picket-guard
under Col. Markham, posted on all the roads leading out of the city;
also an inner guard, under Major Jesse P. Harmon, posted in all the
streets and alleys in the city, and also on the river bank. I also gave
orders to have all the powder and lead in the city secured, and to see
that all the arms were in use, and that all unclaimed arms be put in
the hands of those who could use them.

I insert the affidavit of Anson Call, David Evans and William E. Horner:

    Personally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson, justice of the peace
    of said county, Anson Call, David Evans and William E. Horner, of
    Hancock county and state aforesaid; and being duly sworn, depose
    and say that on Monday, the 17th instant, we started for Rocky Run
    precinct, and arrived yesterday. We then went to Col. Williams' of
    that place, and there soon assembled twenty or thirty men. We were
    informed that Col. Williams had gone to Lima to get the colonel
    there to bring on his regiment. We then informed them that we were
    delegated on behalf of the people of Nauvoo to transact business
    with them. {506} They informed us they had a committee set apart to
    do their business, and that one was absent, and the other two would
    shortly be here. That while a person was seeking the two men, we
    observed to the people that General Smith was willing to be tried
    in any state, for any crime of supposed crime that he had ever
    committed, except in the state of Missouri.

    One of the persons objected to General Smith being tried by the
    Municipal Court in Nauvoo, and declared that nothing else would do
    but for him to be taken upon the old writ, and by the same person
    who took him in custody before, and tried at the place where the
    writ was issued.

    It was then observed that Judge Thomas had advised General Smith
    to enter into bonds to be tried before the Circuit Court, and this
    would allay all the excited feelings of the people.

    It was then moved by one of their company, and sanctioned by the
    people, that a committee should wait on the Judge who gave General
    Smith this advice, and give him a coat of tar and feathers; when
    one John Elliott, of notoriety, agreed to find the tar and feathers
    for that purpose.

    After some further conversation, a man whom they called Lawyer
    Stephens came in from Warsaw, and asked where Col. Williams was.
    He was told that he had gone to Lima. They then observed to the
    lawyer that we were delegates from Nauvoo, when he replied. "We are
    expecting delegates, too, at Warsaw;" and he said the people were
    talking of introducing them to the Mississippi river; and says he,
    "Gentlemen, you can do with your delegates what you think proper."

    A Mr. Crawford, one of the committee, observed that he went against
    such proceedings, and advised them as a body to keep cool. They
    then told the lawyer the advice that the Judge of the Circuit
    Court had given to General Smith, when he said it was unlawful
    advice, and it was a second time moved and assented to that a
    committee should wait on Judge Thomas and give him a coat of tar
    and feathers. The remainder of the committee having come in, they
    stated to us that they had written to the Governor to obtain aid
    from other counties; and if the Governor did not send them aid,
    they were too weak to go themselves now, but were summoning all the
    people that would come into the county until they got force enough
    to come up and take Joseph Smith with the first warrant, and take
    him to the place where the writ was first issued; and nothing less
    than that would satisfy the people.

    SIR.--I have just enclosed to the Governor of the State of Illinois
    copies of the enclosed affidavits and extra. I am sorry to say
    that the State of Missouri, not contented with robbing, driving
    and murdering many of the Latter-day Saints, are now joining the
    mob of this state for the purpose of the "utter extermination" of
    the Mormons, as they have resolved. And now, sir, as President
    of the United States, will you render that protection which the
    Constitution guarantees in case of "insurrection and rebellion,"
    and save the innocent and oppressed from such horrid persecution?

    With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

    John Banks, Joseph Barber, and two others came to your deponents on
    Saturday the 15th inst., at Morley Settlement, in said county, and
    demanded our arms. We replied that we had none, when they required
    of us to go with them to Nauvoo to take Joseph Smith and other
    prisoners, and they promised to supply us with arms. Second, if we
    would not do so, that we were required to leave our homes and go to
    Nauvoo. We must either go against Smith, or take part with him.

    They then told us they intended to go to Nauvoo to take Smith; and
    if they could not take him, they would take some of the head men
    of Smith's clan, and hold them under bonds of death until Smith
    was delivered up to them. And your deponents further say that John
    Banks {509} told them if they could not get volunteers enough, they
    would get a force that would take him.

    Williams, when he told me that I must take up arms and go and fight
    against Joseph Smith, or I must leave the place immediately, or
    else I must give up my arms and stay at home.

    He also said they would take Smith by law if they could; or if the
    Governor would not grant a writ to take him they would take him
    anyhow. He also said, if the people would not give Smith up, they
    would lay the whole city of Nauvoo in ashes.

    I inquired what they would do with those people of Nauvoo who would
    not fight? He said they must make some signal, or else they must
    share the same fate--they must all perish, men, women, and children.

    I then left in order to go home, when Captain Harrison P. Crawford
    overtook me, and told me if the Governor would not help them they
    did not care for the Governor anyhow. He said Governor Ford was an
    unconstitutional man; he had issued two illegal writs, and they
    were done so on purpose: and any such man ought not to hold any
    office whatever; and they intended to proceed against the Mormons
    whether they got any authority from the Governor or not.

    and being first duly sworn, depose and say that on Saturday, the

    certain persons--to wit., George Baker, farmer, John Banks, Esq.,
    Luther Perry, constable, Joseph Barber, farmer; and another person
    whose name we do not know, called upon your deponent, Isaac
    Morley, when John Banks said they waited on him to make three
    propositions--namely: first, that we were to take up arms, join
    with, and go along with them to Nauvoo to arrest one Joseph Smith
    and others, about seventeen in number, living in Nauvoo; second,
    to remove our effects to Nauvoo; or third, to give up our arms to
    them and remain neutral. And said Isaac Morley was required to
    notify all the brethren in the neighborhood, and report to the said
    committee, which of these propositions we accepted, by 8 o'clock on
    Monday morning following; and that one of the above resolutions was

    On the same day said Joseph Barber and Luther Perry went to where
    your deponent, Edmund Durfee, was at work in a field in the same

    must comply with one of the above propositions; if not that said
    Durfee would smell thunder.

    And all your deponents further depose and say that they have
    been compelled to leave their homes and flee to Nauvoo for
    protection. "For we were afraid to stay there on account of the
    mobs threatening to utterly exterminate us," according to a _Warsaw
    Signal_ extra of June, 14th, 1844, if we stayed at home; and

    Personally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson, an acting justice of

    being first duly sworn, depose and say that on Saturday, the 15th
    day of June, 1844, at Morley Settlement in said county, certain
    persons,--to wit., John Clark, John Crawford, Jeremiah Bently, and
    three others, all farmers, came to your deponents and made three
    several propositions to them, to wit: first, that we were to take
    up our arms and join with them in going to Nauvoo, to take Joseph
    Smith and others prisoners; second, to remove with our effects to
    Nauvoo immediately; or, third, to give up our arms to Col. Levi
    Williams and remain neutral.

    We were ordered to give in our decision on Monday then next by
    8 o'clock in the morning; and if we would not agree to their
    decision, we must abide the consequences. And in consequence of
    mobs gathering in the neighborhood, we have been obliged to leave
    our homes in order to save our lives, and are come to Nauvoo for
    protection.

    Solomon Hancock further deposeth and saith that said John Clark did
    on Tuesday, 18th instant, inform your deponent that one of their
    party had gone to St. Louis and had obtained three cannon, and were
    expecting three companies of volunteers from St. Louis to join them

    Personally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson, an acting justice of
    the peace in and for said county, James Guyman, of Green Plains
    precinct in said county; and being first duly sworn deposeth
    and saith that on Saturday morning, the 15th instant, he was at
    Rocky Run precinct, {512} when one Captain Wyers, captain of an
    "Independent Anti-Mormon Minute Men Company," came to a house where
    your deponent was staying. He inquired for a drum. He wanted either
    to borrow it or buy it until the affray with the Mormons was over.

    I asked him how he was going to proceed to take Smith. He then said
    Missouri had offered to send over two thousand men, to come over to
    assist and take him.

    I asked whether it was legal for them to come over here. He replied
    when they came over the constables were going to summons them, and
    also to summons every man who was in or would come into the county.

    I asked if it was according to law to proceed that way, and he
    replied it was, and he went in for the law and democracy. He said
    they had sent two men to the Governor to order the militia out in
    their favor to help to take those criminals: and if he would not
    do just right, they would execute him by taking his head from his
    shoulders.

    I replied, "You said you were a democracy man, and went for the
    law." I said, "Do you call that democracy or mobocracy?"

    He said if they went that far, and if the Governor ordered the
    militia against them instead of in favor of them, he would turn
    mob, and the militia would join him, and they would take the
    Governor's head from his shoulders. He repeated it two or three
    times.

    I enquired if it was law to go and drive those innocent Mormons who
    were living in the neighborhood, or tyrannically compel them to do
    things not agreeable to their will? He allowed that in this case it
    was.

    I asked what he was going to do with these old settlers who would
    neither take up arms and fight against Smith nor in favor of him;
    when he replied they must fight either for one side or the other,
    or they must share the same fate as the Mormons.

    Your deponent further saith that he is not a Mormon, and does not
    belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and
    further saith not.

    Personally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson, an acting justice
    {513} of the peace, in and for said county, Obadiah Bowen, of
    Morley Settlement, in said county; and being first duly sworn,
    deposeth and saith that on Saturday the 15th instant, John Clark
    rode up to where I was at work in Morley Settlement, and said he
    was afraid the Mormons would come and destroy their property;
    "and," said he, "if I have any destroyed by any person, I shall
    make my resort upon the nearest Mormons, and take their property in
    place of that which shall be taken away;" wherever he could find
    it, so long as it was a Mormon's; and that on Tuesday, the 18th
    instant, as I was coming from my house to the road leading to Lima,
    a mob was at the forks of the road standing still and consulting
    together; I came on the road about twenty rods ahead of them. In a
    few moments Colonel Levi Williams, John Clark and five others rode
    along the same road after me.

    I heard them talking about shooting the Mormons, when Clark
    said, "It is no disgrace to shoot a Mormon, anyhow," when they
    all laughed. They overtook me, and Col. Williams asked me where
    I lived. I replied in Morley Settlement. He asked me if I was a
    Mormon, when Clark laid it was no odds--he is on their part.

    Col. Williams then threatened me, and said I must be sure and be
    at his house by nine o'clock in the morning; if not I must either
    get out of Morley Settlement, or be served the same sauce as the
    Mormons. He gave me to understand that they were going to make a
    total destruction of Morley Settlement tomorrow, and I had better
    get out of it.

    He then talked about Joseph Smith, when I replied I understood
    Joseph Smith had a fair trial and was bound over to the Supreme
    Court. He said, "If he is not, we do not care, it is illegally
    done;" and he should go ahead. He should gather the troops, and
    there would be two thousand men landed tomorrow from Missouri. He
    said they were volunteers. They should meet next day at Carthage,
    and then go against Joseph Smith and demolish the city of Nauvoo,
    for have him at any rate they would. He was in a very great
    passion, and let out a great many oaths and [said] other things
    that I have not mentioned.

    In consequence of their threats, and to save our lives, we were
    obliged to leave our homes in a very stormy night, and had to cross
    a dangerous stream that was swollen by the rain, and was unable to
    protect myself from great sufferings and hardships, and came to the
    city of Nauvoo for protection.

    one Col. Levi Williams came to your deponent about sunrise, and
    ordered me out of the house that very day.

    I replied he was very hasty. He again ordered me out of the house,
    and said, if I spoke a word, he would put me out of the house
    immediately.

    I then took away part of my goods and left the house accordingly,
    because I was afraid to stay there another night.

    The next day I went back after the remainder of my property, and
    called at the house of Col. Levi Williams for some things belonging
    to me.

    When I arrived there John Williams, the son of said Levi Williams,
    aged about twenty-eight years, abused me for placing confidence
    in Joseph Smith and the people of Nauvoo. He then took me by the
    back of my neck and pushed me away, and said he would not have
    such stuff in his house. The second time he pushed me by the neck,
    and his foot to my back. He pushed me several times and kicked me.
    Again, when in the street, he kept kicking and pushing me, and
    abusing me with his tongue. I am sixty-one years old. I did not say
    anything to him to cause this abuse; but it was all on account of
    my believing that Joseph Smith and the people of Nauvoo would do
    nothing but what was according to law.

[Sidenote: Reinforcement for Nauvoo from Ramus.]

I had sent orders to Captain Almon W. Babbitt, commander of the company
at Ramus, to come immediately with his company to Nauvoo, and help to
defend the place; and this morning my brother-in-law, William McLeary,
informs my that when the letter was read to the company, Babbitt
refused to come, and said it was a foolish move, and {515} objected
to any of the company coming. The company was marshaled into line,
when Babbitt said, "If any of you go, not one will ever get to Nauvoo
alive," when immediately my Uncle John Smith stepped in front of the
line and said, "Every man that goes at the call of the Prophet shall go
and return safe, and not a hair of his head shall be lost; and I bless
you in the name of the Lord."

The company immediately threw the command upon Uriah B. Yager, who
accepted of it, and started for Nauvoo, although many of them were
destitute of boots or shoes. The company had not traveled five miles
before they suddenly came upon double their number of the mob, who had
two red flags flying, and who had paraded their company and taken a
position in a wood that commanded the road. The company from Macedonia
opened file about ten feet apart and marched past them within rifle
shot, while the mob fired several guns at them, the balls whizzing past
their heads. They came here at daybreak this morning, and I directed

    DEAR GENERAL.--Yours of the 14th of April was received at a late
    date. A multiplicity of business on account of the peculiar state
    of affairs, has prevented a reply till now. Your views about
    the nomination of General Smith for the Presidency are correct.
    We will gain popularity and external influence. But this is not
    all: we mean to elect him, and nothing shall be wanting on our
    part to accomplish it; and why? Because we are satisfied, fully
    satisfied, that this is the best or only method of saving our free
    institutions from a total overthrow.

    You will discover by this day's extra_ Nauvoo Neighbor,_ and
    previous papers which I shall forward with this, that we are
    already being surrounded by an armed mob; and, if we can believe
    a hundredth part of {517} their statements we have no alternative
    but to fight or die. All the horrors of Missouri's murders are
    crowding thick upon us, and the citizens of this county declare in
    mass-meetings, "No peace till the Mormons are utterly exterminated
    from the earth." And for what?

    A band of thieves, counterfeiters, bogus-makers, gamblers,
    debauchers, murderers, and all that is vile, established a
    printing-press in this city for the purpose of carrying on
    all their hellish plans and overthrowing every principle of
    righteousness; and after publishing one number, called the _Nauvoo
    Expositor,_ filled on every column with lies and libel the most
    dark and damnable it were possible for men or demons on the earth
    or in the shades of Gehenna, calculated to destroy every chartered
    right to our peaceful city, and constitutional principles to our
    nation, being destitute of every vestige of truth, and without one
    redeeming quality, either in the paper or the characters of its
    publishers.

    The City Council, on the 10th instant, ordered the press and
    fixtures to be abated as a nuisance which order was executed by
    the proper authorities without delay, without noise, tumult or
    confusion.

    The proprietors immediately evacuated their houses and the city,
    and the night following fired one or more of their buildings, just
    as they did in Missouri, thinking to raise a hue-and-cry that the
    Mormons had done it, and by that means bring a mob on us without
    a moment's delay; but our vigilant police discovered the fire and
    abated that also.

    Chagrined at their disappointment, and drunk with madness, they
    next went to Carthage, the county seat and headquarters of
    mobocracy, and swore that Joseph and about seventeen others had
    committed a riot, and sent a warrant for their apprehension. They
    offered to go before any magistrate in the vicinity and answer to
    the charge. The officer would not consent, but would take them to
    Carthage. They had threatened their lives at Carthage and did not
    consider it safe to go thither, and prayed out a writ of _habeas
    corpus_ from the Municipal Court, and were set free.

    This only enraged the mob the more, and another writ was issued
    by a county magistrate in the vicinity, not a Mormon, before whom
    they were brought, and every exertion made to convict them, but the
    magistrate discharged them.

    This does not satisfy them. They are determined to have "Joe
    Smith," brought before themselves for trial at the headquarters
    of mobocracy swearing that all they want is to get him out of the
    city; and they will shoot the "damned rascal."

    Cannon, ammunition and men are passing over the Mississippi from
    Missouri to Illinois, and the mob is collected by hundreds at
    different points in the county swearing everlasting vengeance; and
    when their oaths and writs will end, God knows.

    {518} We have sent messengers to the Governor, but had no returns,
    and shall dispatch messages to the President of the United States
    next boat.

    If the virtuous part of the community, the state, the nation,
    will come to the rescue of innocence and the rights our fathers
    bled to purchase, that our peace and happiness may be secured to
    us in common with others, it is all we ask; but if they will not,
    and the mob goes on, we say a dishonorable life is worse than an
    honorable death, and we are ready for the onset; and we call upon
    all patriots, far and near, to lend a helping hand to put down the
    mob and restore peace.

    If this is not done immediately, and the mob attempt to execute
    their threats, you may soon have the opportunity of beholding that
    glorious "vision in the west" you have sublimely contemplated in
    your letter.

    I write you at this time at the request of the Prophet, and I
    invite you to come to our assistance with as many volunteers as you
    can bring. And if the mob cannot be dispersed, and the Government
    will not espouse our righteous cause, you may soon, very soon,
    behold the second birth of our nation's freedom; for live without
    the free exercise of thought, and the privilege of worshiping God
    according to the dictates of our consciences, we will not! We will
    die rather, and go where the wicked cease to trouble. But we firmly
    believe there are virtuous men and patriots enough yet left to
    sustain those principles which alone are worth living for. Will you
    come?

    Here is Oregon. Here is California. Where is your ambition?
    Patriotism? Your "separate and independent empire," if you sit
    calmly still and see the most virtuous and noble people that ever
    trod upon the footstool of Jehovah ground to powder by a miscreant
    mob and not stretch forth your potent arm for their defense in all
    the majesty of a God? If you do not, your turn may come next; and
    where will it cease?

    Let the first blow be struck upon us from this hour, and this field
    is open for every honest patriot from the east to the west sea, and
    from the river Mississippi to the ends of the earth.

    General, will you stand neutral? Come, and you will know for
    yourself.

    I close in haste, with good wishes to yourself and family.

    W. RICHARDS.

    GENERAL J. A. BENNETT,

    Arlington House, N. Y.

CHAPTER XXV.

THE TWELVE CALLED FROM EASTERN MISSION--GOVERNOR FORD AT
CARTHAGE--NAUVOO DELEGATION TO GOVERNOR--THREATS AND CONSPIRACY AGAINST
THE PROPHET'S LIFE--GOVERNOR FORD INVITED TO NAUVOO TO INVESTIGATE
CONDITIONS.

[Sidenote: The Apostles Called Home.]

_Thursday, June 20, 1844 [continued].--_I wrote to those of the Twelve
Apostles who are absent on missions to come home immediately, namely,
Brigham Young, Boston; Heber C. Kimball, Washington; Orson Hyde,
Philadelphia; Parley P. Pratt, New York; Orson Pratt, Washington;
Wilford Woodruff, Portage, New York; William Smith, Philadelphia;
George A. Smith, Peterboro; John E. Page, Pittsburgh; and Lyman Wight,
Baltimore. Also to Amasa Lyman, Cincinnati, Ohio, and George Miller,
Richmond, Madison county, Kentucky. I sent the letters by express by
Aaron M. York to the Illinois river, on account of the stoppage of the
mails.

At 8 p.m. Thomas Bullock came and read to me the affidavits of Isaac
Morley, Gardner Snow, John Edmiston, Edmund Durfee, Solomon Hancock,
Allen T. Waite, James Guyman, Obadiah Bowen, Alvah Tippetts, Hiram
B. Mount, and John Cunningham, with the affiants; and afterward the
affidavits were all sworn to before Aaron Johnson, Esquire.

Ten p.m. John Pike and Henry Gates went to the quarters of the
Major-General, and informed him they had seen a number of men driving
about three hundred head of cattle in the direction of the mob camp.
The drovers reported themselves as having come from Missouri, and were
about nine miles from Nauvoo.

[Sidenote: A Prophecy--No Gun Fired on Part of Saints.]

{520} I gave directions to Theodore Turley to commence the manufacture
of artillery. He asked me if he should not rent a building, and set
some men to repairing the small arms which were out of order. I told
him in confidence that there would not be a gun fired on our part
during this fuss.

I extract the following from a letter from Robert D. Foster dated
"Carthage, June 20th, 1844, to John Proctor, Sen., Nauvoo."

    _Letter: Robert D. Foster to John Proctor--Fragment--Instruction as
    to Property_.

    We have a hundred barrels of flour here for the folks, and Nauvoo
    has no means to live, only from the country, and that is cut off
    sure. There are thousands of armed men ready now and thousands more
    coming from Missouri and the country around. Tell John to sleep
    in the barn, and take care of fire and robbery, and all my things
    there, as I shall be home soon. Tell Amos Davis to keep his eyes
    open, as we learn that consecration law will soon commence on him.
    This we know, and he had better look out sharp. Let him read this
    sheet. Tell Norton Gibbs and all my boys that I should be glad to
    see them a minute, but I cannot come. They must be patient and
    faithful, and I will be there and reward every man according to his
    desert; and I won't forget the perjured villains there either.

[Sidenote: Hyrum Smith's Fidelity to the Prophet.]

I advised my brother Hyrum to take his family on the next steamboat and
go to Cincinnati. Hyrum replied, "Joseph, I can't leave you." Whereupon
I said to the company present, "I wish I could get Hyrum out of the
way, so that he may live to avenge my blood, and I will stay with you
and see it out."

_Friday, 21.--_About 10 a.m. I rode out with my guard up Main Street
past the Major-General's quarters, and reviewed the Legion. I returned
to headquarters about 2:30 p.m., having met Col. Elam L. Freeman and
Mr. Bartlett, who came as express from the Governor who had arrived at
Carthage this morning, and they delivered me the following letter:

    {521} _Letter: Governor Ford to Mayor and Council of Nauvoo Asking
    Representatives to Meet him at Carthage_.

    HEADQUARTERS CARTHAGE, June 21st, 1844.

    _To the Honorable the Mayor and Common Council of the City of
    Nauvoo_:

    GENTLEMEN.--Having heard of the excitement in this part of the
    country, and judging that my presence here might be necessary to
    preserve the peace and enforce the laws, I arrived at this place
    this morning. Both before and since my arrival, complaints of a
    grave character have been made to me of certain proceedings of
    your honorable body. As chief magistrate, it is my duty to see
    that impartial justice shall be done, uninfluenced either by the
    excitement here or in your city.

    I think before any decisive measure shall be adopted, that I ought
    to hear the allegations and defenses of all parties. By adopting
    this course I have some hope that the evils of war may be averted,
    and, at any rate, I will be enabled by it to understand the true
    merits of the present difficulties, and shape my course with
    reference to law and justice.

    For these reasons I have to request that you will send out to me
    at this place, one or more well-informed and discreet persons, who
    will be capable of laying before me your version of the matter, and
    of receiving from me such explanations and resolutions as may be
    determined on.

    Col. Elam L. Freeman will present you this note in the character of
    a herald from the Governor. You will respect his character as such
    and permit him to pass and repass free from molestation.

    Your messengers are assured of protection in person and property,
    and will be returned to you in safety.

    I am, gentlemen, with high consideration most respectfully,

    Your obedient servant,

    THOMAS FORD.

    Governor and Commander in Chief.

[Sidenote: Joseph H. Jackson at Nauvoo.]

I immediately notified the City Council to meet in session at 4 p.m.
About 11 a.m. a rumor was circulated at General Dunham's headquarters
that Joseph H. Jackson was seen at Davidson Hibberd's. He [Dunham]
ordered out a _posse_ to arrest him, which went accordingly, but
returned without success.

At 4 p.m. I met with the City Council, when the affidavits of the
following persons were read--namely {522} Isaac Morley, Gardner Snow,
John Edmiston, Edward Durfee, Solomon Hancock, William Gardner, John G.
Lofton, Allen T. Waite, James Guyman, Obadiah Bowen, Alvah Tippetts,
Hiram B. Mount, John Cunningham, Cyrus Canfield, Gilbert Belknap,
Anson Call, David Evans, William E. Horner, Stephen Markham, Thomas
G. Wilson, John P. Greene, John M. Bernhisel, Truman Gillett, Jr.,
Carlos W. Lyon, and H. T. Hugins; when Dr. J. M. Bernhisel, Councilor
John Taylor, and Dr. Willard Richards were appointed by the council to
return with the express to the Governor at Carthage, and carry said
affidavits with the following letter:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Governor Ford--Submitting Documents_.

    NAUVOO, June 21, 1844.

    SIR--The affidavits and handbills herewith connected, are submitted
    for your Excellency's consideration.

    Respectfully, I have the honor to be your Excellency's obedient
    servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    THOMAS FORD, Governor of Illinois, Carthage.

Messrs. Taylor and Bernhisel went accordingly, but Dr. Richards tarried
to prepare additional documents.

The following affidavit was taken:

    _Affidavit: John P. Greene--Joseph H. Jackson,--Threatens Prophet's
    Life_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS, HANCOCK CO.,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss.

    June 21st, 1844.--Personally appeared John P. Greene before me,
    Willard Richards, recorder of said city; and after being duly
    sworn, deposeth and saith that on or about the 27th day of May,
    1844, while at Hamilton's tavern, in Carthage, county aforesaid,
    in company with Joseph Smith and others, Robert D. Foster called
    deponent into a private room, and there and then said, "For God's
    sake, don't suffer that man, Joseph Smith, to go out of doors; for
    if he steps outside of the door his blood will be spilt;" to which
    statement deponent replied he had no such fears; when said Foster
    confirmed said statements with considerable emotion, and said he
    knew that Smith could not go out of doors, but his blood would be
    spilt.

    {523} Deponent asked Foster who would do it. Foster said he would
    not tell; but he knew the proud spirit of Jackson, that he would
    not be insulted, and that he would kill Joseph Smith if he had to
    die on the spot; and there were many others in Carthage who would
    assist to do the same thing. Joseph H. Jackson was in the house
    below at the time.

    A day or two previous to the above conversation, while at Carthage
    aforesaid, deponent heard Joseph H. Jackson say that Joseph Smith
    was the damnedest rascal in the world, and he would be damned if
    he did not take vengeance on him, if he had to follow him to the
    Rocky Mountains; and said Jackson made many more such like threats
    against Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith.

    [Seal]

    WILLARD RICHARDS,

    Recorder of the city of Nauvoo.

And as this affidavit confirms what was told me in Carthage, I made the
following affidavit:

    _Affidavit: Joseph Smith--Conspiracy Against Affiant's Life_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    COUNTY OF HANCOCK. ss.

    CITY OF NAUVOO, June 21st, 1844.

    Personally appeared Joseph Smith before me, Willard Richards,
    recorder of the City of Nauvoo; and after being duly sworn deposeth
    and saith that while at Hamilton's tavern at Carthage, in the
    county aforesaid, on or about the 27th day of May, 1844, whither
    deponent had gone to transact business in the Circuit Court of the
    county aforesaid, Charles A. Foster took deponent into a private
    room, and told deponent there was a conspiracy against the life of
    deponent, and that deponent had not better go out of doors. If he
    did, his blood would be shed. Foster said he was deponent's friend,
    and did not want to see bloodshed.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    [Seal]

    Sworn and subscribed this 21st day of June, 1844, before me,

    WILLARD RICHARDS,

    Recorder of the City of Nauvoo.

I instructed my clerks, Willard Richards, William Clayton, Thomas
Bullock and John McEwan, to prepare all {524} necessary papers and
affidavits ready to be sent to the Governor tomorrow morning.

Joseph Jackson made the two following affidavits:

    _Affidavit: Joseph Jackson--Francis M. Higbee's Threat to Kill the
    Prophet_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss

    On the 21st day of June, 1844, came before me, W. W. Phelps, clerk
    of the Mayor's Court, Joseph Jackson: and after being duly sworn,
    deposeth and saith that on Tuesday, the 11th instant, he was in
    Nauvoo, when Francis M. Higbee, while speaking of the destruction
    of the printing press, said he was very sorry, for the proprietors
    had set up that press for the destruction of the city, and that he
    meant to kill Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith; and he saith no further.

    JOSEPH JACKSON.

    Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 21st day of June, 1844.

    WILLIAM W. PHELPS, Clerk M. C.

    _Affidavit: Joseph Jackson--Reporting Mob at Pilot Grove_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss

    On the 21st day of June, 1844, came before me, W. W. Phelps, clerk
    of the Mayor's Court for said city, Joseph Jackson; and after
    being duly sworn, deposeth and saith, that on the 19th day of June
    instant, at his residence near Pilot Grove, in the afternoon, about
    twenty-four persons fired about twenty-six guns at him, and that
    the balls whistled close by his head. Thus this mob, of which John
    McKay was one, fired about one hundred guns, but not all at your
    affiant; and that this mob was very noisy, cursing and swearing
    that they would kill every damned Mormon; and he says no further.

    JOSEPH JACKSON.

    Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 21st day of June, 1844.

    WILLIAM W. PHELPS, Clerk M. C.

At 7 p.m. James Emmett went by order of the Sergeant of the Guard at
the Stone House to the Major-General and reported the crew of the _Maid
of Iowa_ for firing five guns contrary to orders, which were, that any
firing of guns was an alarm.

After the news had reached the city of the Governor's {525} arrival at
Carthage, an express was sent to Keokuk to stop an express which I had
sent to the Governor at Springfield before I had learned of his arrival
at Carthage.

An officer of the United States army, having arrested a deserter, came
to Nauvoo, and stayed at my house all night.

Col. Brewer and lady arrived at the Mansion about 9 p.m. Also James W.
Woods, Esq., my attorney from Burlington.

At 10 p.m., Private -- Minor gave information that as he was passing,
an hour since, about two miles out of the city to his home, he was
fired upon by some unknown person. General Stephen Markham ordered out
a detachment to proceed to the designated place, scour that part of the
country, and see that all was right.

[_Saturday, June 22.--_]

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Governor Ford--Inviting the Governor to
    Come to Nauvoo and Investigate Conditions_.

    NAUVOO, Saturday Morning, June 22, 1844.

    _To His Excellent Thomas Ford, Governor_:

    DEAR SIR.--I this morning forward you the remainder of the
    affidavits which are ready to present to you, by the hands of a
    gentleman who is fully competent to give you information on the
    whole subject which has been the cause of the origin of our present
    difficulties. I would respectfully recommend the bearer, Col.
    Woodworth, as one of my aides, and a man whose testimony can be
    relied upon.

    I presume you are already convinced that it would be altogether
    unsafe for me or any of the City Council to come to Carthage on
    account of the vast excitement which has been got up by false
    report and libelous publications. Nothing could afford me a greater
    pleasure than a privilege of investigating the whole subject before
    your Excellency in person; for I have ever held myself in readiness
    to comply with your orders and answer for my proceedings before any
    legal tribunal in the state.

    I would hereby respectfully pray your Excellency to come to Nauvoo,
    if congenial with your feelings, and give us a privilege of laying
    the {526} whole matter before you in its true colors, and where
    abundance of testimony can be forthcoming, to prove every point by
    disinterested persons--men of character and of worth and notoriety,
    strangers--who were here all the time. But I am satisfied your
    Excellency does not wish men to expose the lives of the citizens of
    this place by requiring them to put themselves into the power of an
    infuriated, blood-thirsty mob, a part of whom have already several
    times fired upon our people without the least shadow of cause or
    provocation.

    I am informed this morning that some gentleman has made affidavit
    that he had a private conversation with me, in which I stated that
    I had secret correspondence with you, &c. If any person has been
    wicked enough to do this, he is a perjured villain; for in the
    first place, I do not suffer myself to hold private conversation
    with any stranger; and, in the second place, I have never even
    intimated anything of the kind as having secret correspondence with
    your Excellency.

    Our troubles are invariably brought upon us by falsehoods and
    misrepresentations by designing men. We have ever held ourselves
    amenable to the law; and, for myself, sir, I am ever ready
    to conform to and support the laws and Constitution, even at
    the expense of my life. I have never in the least offered any
    resistance to law or lawful process, which is a well-known fact to
    the general public; all of which circumstances make us the more
    anxious to have you come to Nauvoo and investigate the whole matter.

    Now, sir, is it not an easy matter to distinguish between those
    who have pledged themselves to exterminate innocent men, women and
    children, and those who have only stood in their own defense, and
    in defense of their innocent families, and that, too, in accordance
    with the Constitution and laws of the country, as required by the
    oaths, and as good and law-abiding citizens?

    In regard to the destruction of the press, the truth only needs to
    be presented before your Excellency to satisfy you of the justice
    of the proceedings. The press was established by a set of men who
    had already set themselves at defiance of the law and authorities
    of the city, and had threatened the lives of some of its principal
    officers, and who also made it no private matter that the press was
    established for the express purpose of destroying the city, as will
    be shown by the affidavit of Joseph Jackson, and as they stated to
    me in their threats.

    Mr. Babbitt informs me that reports are in circulation that we
    have taken property which belongs to the Messrs. Law and others.
    There has been no property meddled with, to my knowledge, belonging
    to any person, except property we have purchased of the rightful
    owners.

    Mr. Law turned over some property to a Mr. Hicks, to pay a debt.
    This I purchased of Mr. Hicks, and I am responsible to him for
    the {527} amount. We have been especially careful to preserve the
    property of those who are exciting the public against us, inasmuch
    as we know that every means would be used which could be invented
    to raise excitement; and we have appointed the police to watch this
    property and see that no harm was done to it by any person, as they
    had tried to fire their own building and were detected in the act.
    The fire was extinguished by the policemen, and no property damaged.

    There have been no prisoners taken in this city, neither any person
    held as hostage, only some who are residents of this place, who had
    broken the laws. No stranger has been interfered with or detained
    in the city under any circumstances.

    In haste, I have the honor to remain, dear sir, your most obedient
    servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    Lieut.-Gen. N. L.

This letter was accompanied by other affidavits, and was sent by Lucien
Woodworth, who was delegated to go in place of Dr. Richards. He started
at noon in company with Squire Woods of Burlington.

PREPARATIONS TO DEFEND NAUVOO--MOB MOVEMENTS ON CARTHAGE ROAD--GOVERNOR
FORD'S REVIEW OF HANCOCK COUNTY DIFFICULTIES--JOSEPH SMITH'S ACCOUNT OF
THE SAME DIFFICULTIES, DEFENSE OF HIS OWN AND ASSOCIATES' COURSE.

_Saturday, June 22 [continued].--_Legion met as usual; and after
receiving instructions, were dismissed until 6 p.m., when they met
again.

[Sidenote: Orders for Nauvoo's Entrenchment.]

At 7 p.m. I instructed General Dunham to cause the regiment of the 2nd
cohort to turn out tomorrow, and work by turns three or four hours
each, with entrenching tools, and to take the best measures in case of
attack. I also gave orders that a standard be prepared for the nations.

Almon W. Babbitt arrived from Carthage this morning, having come at the
request of the Governor, who thought it not wisdom to have Richards and
Phelps and others of the City Council go to Carthage.

Edward Robinson made the following affidavit:

    _Affidavit: Edward Robinson--Threats Against Nauvoo_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss.

    On the 22nd day or June, 1844, came before me, W. W. Phelps, clerk
    of the Mayor's Court, in said city, Dr. Edward Robinson, who, after
    being duly sworn, deposeth and saith that while at Carthage, on the
    18th and 19th instant, I heard several persons who had assembled
    together for warlike purposes, (having their arms and one cannon
    with them) say that they were gathering together for the purpose
    of destroying the property of General Joseph Smith, or, as they
    said, "Joe Smith," and his followers, and the City Council, with

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY. ss

    CITY OF NAUVOO, June 22nd, 1844.

    Personally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson, a justice of the
    peace in and for said county, James Olive; who being first duly
    sworn, deposeth and saith that on Friday afternoon, the 21st
    instant, about 3 o'clock, he was at his own house, about two miles
    from Appanoose. In a southeasterly direction, he saw a four-horse
    wagon with some men before it, all traveling towards Appanoose.
    They went about a quarter of a mile beyond my house; there met a
    two horse wagon and a company of men, about fifteen in number.
    Both parties then took the road towards the Big Mound. A part of
    the men were mounted and a part were on foot. The mounted men were
    forward; and after passing my house, they wheeled and rode back to
    the footmen who were some little distance behind, and said to them,
    "There are some fellows oh the Mound; you had better hurry on, and
    we will take those fellows and carry them to Carthage." They used
    profane language. I watched them until they got near the Mound, and
    saw the guard on the Mound turn and run towards Nauvoo. After that
    the company went on to the Mound, and halted near the spot where
    the guard had run from.

    On the same evening, about sundown, there was a man by the name
    of Milton Hamilton came into my house and told me to arm and
    equip myself according to the law and stand in readiness; that
    the Governor bad demanded Joseph Smith according to law, and
    that he would not come it (meaning that Joseph Smith would not
    surrender); that the General had issued orders for the militia to
    be in readiness to take said Smith. I asked him what general, and
    he observed that he believed it was Col. Williams. I asked him if
    it was done by orders of the Governor, and he said that was the
    understanding. He told me he acted under the orders of Captain
    McAuley; and further saith not.

    on Spring Creek in McDonough county; who, being first duly sworn,
    deposeth and saith that yesterday, Napoleon Hardin came to your
    deponent and said that the Governor had sent orders for the militia
    to be called out for today at 4 o'clock p.m., and to start on the
    22nd to Carthage, there to wait until all were ready from the
    different counties in the state, and then they should march out
    to the prairie. They should stop on the prairie and send a flag
    of truce to Nauvoo, and demand the body of General Joseph Smith.
    If the people of Nauvoo refused to give him up, then they should
    exterminate the whole of them.

    La Harpe road, a party of about eight or ten men, in a warlike
    attitude, in company with two teams, passed your said affiant, and

    killed them both and your deponent saith no further.

{531} Luman H. Calkins made the following affidavit:

    _Affidavit: Luman H. Calkins--Nauvoo Conspiracy Against the
    Prophet's Life_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO, ss

    June 22nd, 1844.

    Personally appeared before me, George W. Harris, an alderman acting
    in and for the city of Nauvoo, Luman H. Calkins; and being first
    duly sworn, deposeth and saith that about seven weeks ago I came on
    the steamboat _Ohio_ from St. Louis to Nauvoo, when William Nesbit,
    who was on board, entered into conversation with your deponent.

    I asked him if he knew anything about the conspiracy in Nauvoo to
    kill Joseph and Hyrum, and all that believed on them. He said he
    did. It was intended that they should be killed between then and
    the 1st of July.

    I asked him who was at the head of the conspiracy. He replied he
    was sworn not to tell who the head one was. I asked him if there
    were any in Nauvoo concerned. He replied there was, and named the
    two Laws, two Fosters, two Higbees, Charles Ivins, and several
    others. I asked if it was to be made a public thing. He replied the
    first blow was to be struck in Nauvoo by those who were opposed to
    Joseph. I asked how many they could rely on in Nauvoo. He said they
    could rely on five hundred, if they could only get arms for them.

    He said as soon as the first blow was struck in Nauvoo, there
    were about seven thousand men ready in Missouri to join them to
    exterminate all who believed on Joseph Smith. He also told me that
    the _Die Vernon,_ when she came on her pleasure-trip to Nauvoo,
    that there were none but spies, and who came on purpose to see
    the places in order to know how to strike when the time comes to
    strike: and he also said "the Reformers" had got spies continually
    passing Nauvoo in order to spy out all that took place; that there
    was not a thing took place in Nauvoo but what was made known to
    them in St. Louis as soon as a steamboat landed.

    I told him I should think he would be afraid to stop here. He said
    he should stay in Nauvoo and carry on his butchering as usual, as
    if there was nothing taking place; that he had as good a gun as any
    man ever put to his face, and that the first shot he should fire
    would be to kill Joseph and Hyrum. Said I, "The people will surely
    kill you then." He replied he would rush through a thousand people
    to wash his hands in Joseph's blood, and especially in Hyrum's, if
    he was to be immediately cut into a thousand pieces. He said he
    should be willing to die as soon as he had killed them.

    {532} About five weeks since I had another conversation with
    William Nesbit, when he confirmed the whole of the foregoing
    conversation; and he also said he had made arrangements with Mr.
    Bostwick of St. Louis to send him a brace of the best pistols, for
    the purpose of being ready when he wanted them. He also said that
    he would kill Hyrum any time he could get an opportunity without
    being detected. I then asked him if Hyrum could be put in his way
    so that no man would mistrust him, would you kill him? He said, "By
    God, I would." I asked if he would not be afraid to kill him in
    cold blood. He replied, "No, I would not; I would do it in a moment
    if I could get an opportunity."

    The day following I left for Galena, and returned on Tuesday, the
    18th instant, and on the 19th I saw William Nesbit in the ranks,
    and I cautioned Richard Brazier to keep an eye on Nesbit, for he
    had sworn to wash his hands in Joseph's and Hyrum's blood.

At 10 p.m. I received the following letter by the hands of Captain
Yates, who accompanied Elder John Taylor and Dr. John M. Bernhisel on
their return from Carthage:

    _Letter: Governor Ford to Mayor and Council of the City of Nauvoo_.

    HEADQUARTERS CARTHAGE, June 22nd, 1844.

    _To the Mayor and Council of the City of Nauvoo_:

    GENTLEMEN.--After examining carefully all the allegations on the
    part of the citizens of the country in Hancock county, and the
    defensive matters submitted to me by the committee of your citizens
    concerning the existing disturbances, I find that there appears
    to be but little contradiction as to important facts, so that it
    may be safely assumed that the immediate cause of the existing
    excitement is the destruction of the press and _Nauvoo Expositor,_
    and the subsequent refusal of the individuals accused to be
    accountable therefore according to the general laws of this state,
    and the insisting on your parts to be accountable only before your
    own municipal court, and according to the ordinances of your city.

    Many other facts have been asserted on both sides as tending to
    increase the excitement; but as they mostly relate merely to
    private persons, and committed by individuals, and tend simply to
    show the present state of affairs, I will not further notice them
    in this communication.

    The material facts to be noticed are that a newspaper called the
    _Nauvoo Expositor_ was established in Nauvoo; that this newspaper
    was {534} deemed offensive to the people of that city; that the
    Common Council, without notice or process to the owners, entered
    into a trial and heard statements not under oath, and evidence
    which was under oath, in relation to the character, conduct
    and designs of the owners and editors of the press; that, upon
    hearing such statements and evidence, the Common Council passed
    an ordinance or resolution declaring said press and paper to be a
    public nuisance, and ordered the same to be abated as such; that a
    writ was issued by the Mayor to the Marshal of the city for that
    purpose; that a military order was issued at the same time by the
    Mayor, who is also Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion, to the
    Major-General in command of that Legion, for a force sufficient to
    ensure the execution of the writ aforesaid.

    It appears also the press was destroyed in obedience to the
    foregoing ordinance and writ, according to a return on the same by
    the Marshal in the following words: "The within press and type is
    destroyed and pied according to order on this 10th day of June,
    1844, at about six o'clock p.m.--J. P. GREENE, C.M."

    It appears also that the owners of the press obtained from a
    justice of the peace at Carthage a warrant against the authors
    of this destruction for a riot; that the constable charged with
    the execution of this process, arrested some of the persons
    accused, who immediately obtained writs of _habeas corpus_ from
    the Municipal Court of your city, by virtue of which they were
    tried in Nauvoo and discharged from arrest, and that they have ever
    since refused to be arrested or to submit to a trial at any other
    place or before any other court, except in the city and before the
    Municipal Court aforesaid.

    It has also been reported to me that martial law has been declared
    in Nauvoo; that persons and property have been and are now forcibly
    imprisoned and detained there, and that the Legion has been ordered
    under arms to resist any attempt to arrest the persons accused.
    I have not particularly inquired into the truth of these latter
    reports; for although they may become matters of great importance
    in the sequel, they are not necessary to be ascertained and acted
    upon at present.

    I now express to you my opinion that your conduct in the
    destruction of the press was a very gross outrage upon the laws and
    the liberties of the people. It may have been full of libels, but
    this did not authorize you to destroy it.

    There are many newspapers in this state which have been wrongfully
    abusing me for more than a year, and yet such is my regard for
    the liberty of the press and the rights of a free people in a
    republican government that I would shed the last drop of my blood
    to protect those presses from any illegal violence. You have
    violated the Constitution in at least four particulars. You have
    violated that part of it which {535} declares that the printing
    presses shall be free, being responsible for the abuse thereof, and
    that the truth may be given in evidence.

    This article of the Constitution contemplates that the proprietors
    of a libelous press may be sued for private damages, or may be
    indicted criminally, and that upon trial they should have the right
    to give the truth in evidence. In this case the proprietors had no
    notice of the proceeding.

    The Constitution also provides that the people shall be protected
    against unreasonable searches and seizures of their property and
    "That no man shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, except
    by the judgment of his peers (which means a jury trial) and the
    law of the land," which means due process of law and notice to the
    accused.

    You have also violated the Constitution and your own charter in
    this: Your Council, which has no judicial powers, and can only pass
    ordinances of a general nature, have undertaken to pass judgment as
    a court and convict without a jury a press of being libelous and a
    nuisance to the city.

    The Council at most could only define a nuisance by general
    ordinance, and leave it to the courts to determine whether
    individuals or particulars accused came within such definition.

    The Constitution abhors and will not tolerate the union of
    legislative and judicial power in the same body of magistracy,
    because, as in this case, they will first make a tyrannical law,
    and then execute it in a tyrannical manner.

    You have also assumed to yourselves more power than you are
    entitled to in relation to writs of _habeas_ under your charter.
    I know that you have been told by lawyers, for the purpose of
    gaining your favor that you have this power to any extent. In this
    they have deceived you for their own base purposes. Your charter
    supposes that you may pass ordinances, a breach of which will
    result in the imprisonment of the offender.

    For the purpose of insuring more speedy relief to such persons,
    authority was given to the Municipal Court to issue writs of_
    habeas corpus_ in all cases arising under the ordinances of the
    city.

    It was never supposed by the Legislature, nor can the language of
    your charter be tortured to mean that a jurisdiction was intended
    to be conferred which would apply to all cases of imprisonment
    under the general laws of the state or of the United States, as
    well as the city ordinances.

    It has also been reserved to you to make the discovery that a
    newspaper charged to be scurrilous and libellous may be legally
    abated or removed as a nuisance. In no other state, county, city,
    town or territory {536} in the United States has ever such a thing
    been thought of before. Such an act at this day would not be
    tolerated even in England. Just such another act in 1830 hurled
    the king of France from his throne, and caused the imprisonment of
    four of his principal ministers for life. No civilized country can
    tolerate such conduct, much less can it be tolerated in this free
    country of the United States.

    The result of my deliberations on this subject is, that I will
    have to require you and all persons in Nauvoo accused or sued to
    submit in all cases implicitly to the process of the court, and
    to interpose no obstacles to an arrest, either by writ of _habeas
    corpus_ or otherwise; and that all of the people of the city of
    Nauvoo shall make and continue the most complete submission to the
    laws of the state, and the process of the courts and justices of
    the peace.

    In the particular case now under consideration, I require any and
    all of you who are or shall be accused to submit yourselves to be
    arrested by the same constable, by virtue of the same warrant and
    be tried before the same magistrate whose authority has heretofore
    been resisted. Nothing short of this can vindicate the dignity of
    violated law and allay the just excitement of the people.

    I am anxious to preserve the peace. A small indiscretion may bring
    on a war. The whole country is now up in arms, and a vast number of
    people are ready to take the matter into their own hands. Such a
    state of things might force me to call out the militia to prevent
    a civil war. And such is the excitement of the country that I fear
    the militia, when assembled, would be beyond legal control.

    You are wrong in the first instance, and I can call out no portion
    of the militia for your defense until you submit to the law. You
    have made it necessary that a _posse_ should be assembled to
    execute legal process; and that _posse,_ as fast as it assembles
    is in danger of being imbued with the mobocratic spirit. If you,
    by refusing to submit, shall make it necessary to call out the
    militia, I have great fears that your city will be destroyed, and
    your people many of them exterminated.

    You know the excitement of the public mind. Do not tempt it too
    far. A very little matter may do a very great injury; and if you
    are disposed to continue the causes of excitement and render a
    force necessary to coerce submission, I would say that your city
    was built, as it were, upon a keg of powder which a very little
    spark may explode.

    It is my intention to do all I can to preserve the peace, and
    even, if obliged, to call the militia to prosecute the war so
    as not to involve the innocent and comprehend all in the same
    punishment. But excitement is a matter which grows very fast upon
    men when assembled. The {537} affair, I much fear, may assume a
    revolutionary character, and the men may disregard the authority of
    their officers.

    I tell you plainly that if no such submission is made as I have
    indicated. I will be obliged to call out the militia; and if a few
    thousand will not be sufficient, many thousands will be.

    I sincerely hope that your people may do nothing which will
    make such a proceeding necessary. I hope also that they will be
    well-disposed to co-operate with me in allaying the excitement of
    the public mind. Immediately discharge such persons as you have
    under martial law. Let them go without molestation. Abstain from
    all injury to private property. Let people go where they please
    without swearing them first to take no part against you. All such
    proceedings tend only to inflame the public mind, and raise up ten
    men disposed to fight you for every one thus foolishly disabled.

    Your committee assures me that you are sincerely desirous of
    preserving the peace; and if so, I hope you will co-operate with me
    in everything necessary to allay the excitement in the minds of the
    people.

    The following-named persons are reported to me as being detained
    against their will by martial law: John A. Hicks, H. O. Norton, A.
    J. Higbee, John Eagle, P. J. Rolf, Peter Lemon, and T. J. Rolf. It
    will tend greatly to allay excitement if they shall be immediately
    discharged and suffered to go without molestation.

    It is also reported here, and generally believed, (but whether true
    or not I have not yet learned) that there are many foraging parties
    abroad from Nauvoo committing depredations upon the cattle and
    property in the vicinity. These acts, if correctly reported, must
    absolutely cease immediately, if you expect any person here to have
    the power to preserve the peace.

    In case the persons accused should make no resistance to arrest, it
    will be against orders to be accompanied by others. If it should
    become necessary to have witnesses on the trials, I will see that
    such persons shall be duly summoned,_ and I will also guarantee the
    safety of all such persons as may thus be brought to this place
    from Nauvoo either for trial or as witnesses for the accused_.

    If the individuals accused cannot be found when required by the
    constable it will be considered by me as an equivalent to a refusal
    to be arrested, and the militia will be ordered accordingly.

    I am, gentlemen, with great respect, your obedient servant,

    THOMAS FORD,

    Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

To which I wrote the following answer:

    {538} _Letter: Joseph Smith to Governor Ford--Defending the action
    of the City Council in the "Expositor" Affair_.

    NAUVOO, June 22nd, 1844, 12 o'clock p.m.

    _To His Excellency, Thomas Ford_:

    SIR.--Yours of this date is received by Messrs. Taylor and
    Bernhisel. A part of the same delegation, Mr. Woodworth, who
    was detained yesterday, started for Carthage at 12 noon, this
    date, who, we perceive, had not arrived at your last date. Some
    documents conveyed by him would tend to counteract some of the
    views expressed in your Excellency's communication, and we feel
    confident, if all the facts could be before your Excellency, you
    would have come to different conclusions.

    Our "insisting to be accountable only before our own Municipal
    Court," is totally incorrect. We plead a _habeas corpus_ as a
    last resort to save us from being thrown into the power of the
    mobocrats, who were then threatening us with death, and it was with
    great reluctance we went before the Municipal Court, on account of
    the prejudice which might arise in the minds of the unbiased; and
    we did not petition for a _habeas corpus_ until we had told the
    constable that on our lives we dare not go to Carthage for trial,
    and plead with him to go before any county magistrate he pleased in
    our vicinity, (which occurrence is common in legal proceedings) and
    not a member of our society, so that our lives might be saved from
    the threats thus already issued against us.

    The press was declared a nuisance under the authority of the
    charter as written in 7th section of Addenda, the same as in the
    Springfield charter, so that if the act declaring the press a
    nuisance was unconstitutional: we cannot see how it is that the
    charter itself is not unconstitutional, and if we have erred in
    judgment, it is an official act, and belongs to the Supreme Court
    to correct it, and assess damages _versus_ the city to restore
    property abated as a nuisance. If we have erred in this thing, we
    have done it in good company, for Blackstone on "Wrongs," asserts
    the doctrine that scurrilous prints may be abated as nuisances.

    As to martial law, we truly say that we were obliged to call out
    the forces to protect our lives; and the Constitution guarantees
    to every man that privilege; and our measures were active and
    efficient, as the necessity of the case required; but the city is
    and has been continually under the special direction of the marshal
    all the time. No person, to our knowledge, has been arrested only
    for violation of the peace, and those some of our own citizens,
    all of whom we believe are now discharged. {539} And if any
    property has been taken for public benefit without a compensation,
    or against the will of the owner, it has been done without our
    knowledge or consent, and when shown shall be corrected, if the
    people will permit us to resume our usual labors.

    If we "have committed a gross outrage upon the laws and liberties
    of the people," as your Excellency represents, we are ready to
    correct that outrage when the testimony is forthcoming. All men are
    bound to act in their sphere on their own judgment, and it would
    be quite impossible for us to know what your Excellency's judgment
    would have been in the case referred to; consequently acted on our
    own and according to our best judgment, after having taken able
    counsel in the case. If we have erred, we again say we will make
    all right if we can have the privilege.

    "The Constitution also provides that the people shall be protected
    against all unreasonable search and seizure." True. The doctrine we
    believe most fully, and have acted upon it; but we do not believe
    it unreasonable to search so far as it is necessary to protect life
    and property from destruction.

    We do not believe in the "union of legislative and judicial power,"
    and we have not so understood the action of the case in question.

    Whatever power we have exercised in the _habeas corpus_ has been
    done in accordance with the letter of the charter and Constitution
    as we confidently understood them, and that, too, with the ablest
    counsel; but if it be so that we have erred in this thing, let the
    Supreme Court correct the evil. We have never gone contrary to
    constitutional law, so far as we have been able to learn it. If
    lawyers have belied their profession to abuse us, the evil be on
    their heads.

    You have intimated that no press has been abated as a nuisance in
    the United States. We refer your Excellency to Humphrey _versus_
    Press in Ohio, who abated the press by his own arm for libel, and
    the courts decided on prosecution no cause of action. And we do
    know that it is common for police in Boston, New York, &c., to
    destroy scurrilous prints: and we think the loss of character by
    libel and the loss of life by mobocratic prints to be a greater
    loss than a little property, all of which, life alone excepted,
    we have sustained, brought upon us by the most unprincipled
    outlaws, gamblers, counterfeiters, and such characters as have
    been standing by me, and probably are now standing around your
    Excellency--namely, those men who have brought these evils upon us.

    We have no knowledge of men's being sworn to pass our city. And
    upon receipt of your last message the Legion was disbanded and the
    city left to your Excellency's disposal.

    {540} How it could be possible for us now to be tried
    constitutionally by the same magistrate who first issued the writ
    at Carthage we cannot see, for the Constitution expressly says
    no man shall twice be put in jeopardy of life and limb for the
    same offense; and all you refer to, have been, since the issuance
    of the_ habeas corpus,_ complied with for the same offense, and
    trial before Daniel H. Wells, justice of the peace for Hancock
    county, and, after a full investigation, were discharged. But,
    notwithstanding this, we would not hesitate to stand another trial
    according to your Excellency's wish, were it not that we are
    confident out lives would be in danger. We dare not come. Writs, we
    are assured, are issued against us in various parts of the country.
    For what? To drag us from place to place, from court to court,
    across the creeks and prairies, till some bloodthirsty villain
    could find his opportunity to shoot us. We dare not come, though
    your Excellency promises protection. Yet, at the same time, you
    have expressed fears that you could not control the mob, in which
    case we are left to the mercy of the merciless. Sir, we dare not
    come, for our lives would be in danger, and we are guilty of no
    crime.

    You say, "It will be against orders to be accompanied by others,
    if we come to trial." This we have been obliged to act upon in
    Missouri; and when our witnesses were sent for by the court, (as
    your honor promises to do) they were thrust into prison, and we
    left without witnesses. Sir, you must not blame us, for "a burnt
    child dreads the fire." And although your Excellency might be
    well-disposed in the matter, the appearance of the mob forbids our
    coming. We dare not do it.

    We have been advised by legal and high-minded gentlemen from
    abroad, who came on the boat this evening to lay our grievances
    before the Federal Government, as the appearance of things is not
    only treasonable against us, but against the state on the part of
    Missouri, unless the same has been requested of Governor Ford by
    the Federal Government. And we suppose your Excellency is well
    aware by this time that the mass-meetings of the county declared
    utter extermination of the Mormons, and that the Legion was not
    called out until complaints were made to the Mayor, and the
    citizens were afraid of their lives, and losing their confidence
    in the authorities of the city, and that nothing on the part of
    the city authorities had been wanting, legally and judiciously,
    to allay excitement and restore peace. We shall leave the city
    forthwith to lay the facts before the General Government, and,
    as before stated, the city is left open and unprotected; and by
    everything that is sacred, we implore your Excellency to cause our
    helpless women and children to be protected from mob violence, and
    let not the blood of innocence {541} cry to heaven against you.
    We again say, if anything wrong has been done on our part, and we
    know of nothing, we will make all things right if the Government
    will give us the opportunity. Disperse the mob, and secure to us
    our constitutional privileges, that our lives may not be endangered
    when on trial.

    I remain most respectfully, your Excellency's humble servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    Mayor, and Lieut.-Gen. N. L.

CHAPTER XXVII.

GOVERNOR FORD'S WRONG VIEWPOINT--ELDER TAYLOR'S ACCOUNT OF THE
INTERVIEW WITH THE GOVERNOR AT CARTHAGE--CLOSE OF THE PROPHET'S JOURNAL
NARRATIVE OF HIS LIFE.

[Sidenote: Gov. Ford's Biased Judgment.]

_[Saturday, June 22nd, 1844, continued].--_It appears that the
Governor, on arriving at Carthage, ordered the entire mob into service,
adopted the lies and misrepresentations circulated against us by our
enemies as truth, turned Supreme Court, and decided on the legality
of our municipal ordinances and proceedings, which is the business
of the judiciary alone. He charges us in his letter, based upon most
cursed falsehoods, with violations of law and order, which have never
been thought of by us. He treated our delegates very rudely. My
communications that were read to him were read in the presence of a
large number of our worst enemies, who interrupted the reader at almost
every line with, "That's a damned lie!" and "That's a G--d--d lie!" He
never accorded to them the privilege of saying one word to him only in
the midst of such interruptions as, "You lie like hell!" from a crowd
of persons present. These facts show conclusively that he is under the
influence of the mob spirit, and is designedly intending to place us in
the hands of murderous assassins, and is conniving at our destruction,
or else that he is so ignorant and stupid that he does not understand
the corrupt and diabolical spirits that are around him.

{543} Elder John Taylor gave the following account of his interview
with the Governor:

    _Elder John Taylor's Account of Interview With Governor Ford at
    Carthage_.

    After waiting the Governor's pleasure for some time, we had an
    audience--but such an audience! He was surrounded by some of the
    vilest and most unprincipled men in creation. Some of them had
    an appearance of respectability, but many of them lacked even
    that. Wilson, and, I believe, William Law were there, Foster,
    Frank and Chauncey Higbee, Mr. Marr, a lawyer from Nauvoo, a
    mobocratic merchant from Warsaw, Joseph H. Jackson, a number of his
    associates, and the Governor's secretary--in all fifteen or twenty
    persons, most of whom were recreant to virtue, honor, integrity
    and everything that is considered honorable among men. I can well
    remember the feelings of disgust that I had in seeing the Governor
    surrounded by such an infamous group, and on being introduced to
    men of so questionable a character; and had I been on private
    business, I should have turned to depart, and told the Governor
    that if he thought proper to associate with such questionable
    characters, I should beg leave to be excused; but coming, as we
    did, on public business, we could not of course consult our private
    feelings.

    We then stated to the Governor that, in accordance with his
    request, General Joseph Smith had, in response to his call, sent
    us to him as a committee of conference; that we were acquainted
    with most of the circumstances that had transpired in and about
    Nauvoo lately, and were prepared to give him the information;
    that, moreover, we had in our possession testimony and affidavits
    confirmatory of what we should say, which had been forwarded to him
    by General Joseph Smith; that communications had been forwarded to
    his Excellency by Messrs. Hunter, James and others, some of which
    had not reached their destination, but of which we had duplicates
    with us. We then in brief related an outline of the difficulties,
    and the course we had pursued from the commencement of the troubles
    up to the present, and, handing him the documents, respectfully
    submitted the whole. During our conversation and explanations with
    the Governor, we were frequently rudely and impudently contradicted
    by the fellows he had around him, and of whom he seemed to take no
    notice.

    He opened and read a number of the documents himself, and as he
    proceeded he was frequently interrupted by, "That's a lie!" "That's
    a G-- d--d lie!" "That's an infernal falsehood!" "That's a blasted
    lie!" &c.

    {544} These men evidently winced on an exposure of their acts, and
    thus vulgarly, impudently and falsely repudiated them. One of their
    number, Mr. Marr, addressed himself several times to me while in
    conversation with the Governor. I did not notice him until after a
    frequent repetition of his insolence, when I informed him that my
    business at that time was with Governor Ford, whereupon I continued
    my conversation with his Excellency.

    During the conversation the Governor expressed a desire that Joseph
    Smith and all parties concerned in passing or executing the city
    law in relation to the press had better come to Carthage; that
    however repugnant it might be to our feelings, he thought it would
    have a tendency to allay public excitement and prove to the people
    what we professed--that we wished to be governed by law.

    We represented to him the course we had taken in relation to this
    matter, our willingness to go before another magistrate other
    than the Municipal Court, the illegal refusal by the constable,
    of our request, our dismissal by the Municipal Court, a legally
    constituted tribunal, our subsequent trial before Esq. Wells at the
    instance of Judge Thomas (the circuit judge), and our dismissal by
    him; that we had fulfilled the law in every particular; that it
    was our enemies who were breaking the law, and, having murderous
    designs, were only making use of this as a pretext to get us into
    their power.

    The Governor stated that the people viewed it differently, and
    that, notwithstanding our opinions, he would recommend that the
    people should be satisfied.

    We then remarked to him that, should Joseph Smith comply with his
    request, it would be extremely unsafe, in the present excited
    state of the country, to come without an armed force; that we had
    a sufficiency of men, and were competent to defend ourselves, but
    that there might be danger of collision should our forces and those
    of our enemies be brought in such close proximity.

    He strenuously advised us not to bring any arms, and pledged his
    faith as Governor, and the faith of the state, that we should be
    protected, and that he would guarantee our perfect safety.

    At the termination of our interview, and previous to our
    withdrawal, after a long conversation and the perusal of the
    documents which we had brought, the Governor informed us that he
    would prepare a written communication for General Joseph Smith,
    which he desired us to wait for. We were kept waiting for this
    instrument some five or six hours.

    About five o'clock in the afternoon we took our departure with not
    the most pleasant feelings. The associations of the Governor, the
    spirit that he manifested to compromise with these scoundrels, the
    {545} length of time that he had kept us waiting, and his general
    deportment, together with the infernal spirit that we saw exhibited
    by those whom he admitted to his counsels, made the prospect
    anything but promising.

I had a consultation for a little while with my brother Hyrum, Dr.
Richards, John Taylor and John M. Bernhisel, and determined to go to
Washington and lay the matter before President Tyler. [1]

About 7 p.m. I requested Reynolds Cahoon and Alpheus Cutler to stand
guard at the Mansion, and not to admit any stranger inside the house.

At sundown I asked O. P. Rockwell if he would go with me a short
journey, and he replied he would.

[Abraham C. Hodge says that soon after dusk, Joseph called Hyrum,
Willard Richards, John Taylor, William W. Phelps, A. C. Hodge, John L.
Butler, Alpheus Cutler, William Marks and some others, into his upper
room and said, "Brethren, here is a letter from the Governor which I
wish to have read." After it was read through Joseph remarked, "There
is no mercy--no mercy here." Hyrum said, "No; just as sure as we fall
into their hands we are dead men." Joseph replied, "Yes; what shall we
do, Brother Hyrum?" He replied, "I don't know." All at once Joseph's
countenance brightened up and he said, "The way is open. It is clean
to my mind what to do. All they want is Hyrum and myself; then tell
everybody to go about their business, and not to collect in groups,
but to scatter about. There is no doubt they will come here and search
for us. Let them search; they will not harm you in person or property,
and not even a hair of your head. We will cross the river tonight, and
{546} go away to the West." He made a move to go out of the house to
cross the river. When out of doors he told Butler and Hodge to take the
_Maid of Iowa,_ (in charge of Repsher) get it to the upper landing,
and put his and Hyrum's families and effects upon her; then go down
the Mississippi and up the Ohio river to Portsmouth, where they should
hear from them. He then took Hodge by the hand and said, "Now, Brother
Hodge, let what will come, don't deny the faith, and all will be well."]

I told Stephen Markham that if I and Hyrum were ever taken again we
should be massacred, or I was not a prophet of God. I want Hyrum to
live to avenge my blood, but he is determined not to leave me. [2]

Footnotes:

1. "At this juncture the council was interrupted by the withdrawal of
President Smith to give an interview to two gentlemen--one of whom
was a son of John C. Calhoun--who had arrived at the Mansion and were
anxious to meet with the Prophet" (Life of John Taylor, page, 125).
Elder Taylor withdrew at a late hour from the council because of great
weariness. "Shortly after he [Elder Taylor] retired, however, the
Prophet returned, and the informal council meeting was resumed. The
project of laying the case before President Tyler was abandoned. Joseph
had received an inspiration to go west and all would be well" (Ibid).

2. Here the direct narrative of the Prophet ends; what happened in the
next few days of his life occurred under such circumstances as not to
permit of his dictating an account of it to his secretary or clerks, as
was his custom.

Concerning the statement in the text about the Prophet's desire to have
Hyrum live, and the purpose of it, Mr. Edward Tullidge, in his _Life
of Joseph the Prophet_, gives a different version of it. He states
it_: "I want Hyrum to live to lead the Church, but he is determined
not to leave me"_ (Tullidge, p. 491). On what authority Mr. Tullidge
makes the change is not known; but there is evidence in addition to his
statement that the Prophet did desire Hyrum Smith to succeed him in the
presidency of the Church, and even "ordained" him to take that place.
At the October conference following the martyrdom of the two brothers,
President Brigham Young said_: "Did Joseph ordain any man to take his
place? He did. Who was it? It was Hyrum. But Hyrum fell a martyr before
Joseph did"_ (_Times and Seasons_ Vol. 5, page 683.)

THE PROPHET STARTS FOR THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS--THE COUNSEL OF FALSE
BRETHREN--THE RETURN TO NAUVOO--THE SURRENDER AND ARRIVAL AT CARTHAGE.

_An account of the arrest, imprisonment and martyrdom of President
Joseph Smith and Patriarch Hyrum Smith in Carthage jail, Hancock
county, Illinois, as collected from the journal kept at the time by
Willard Richards and the statements published by John Taylor, Messrs.
Reid and Woods and John S. Fullmer, and the writings and statements of
Dan Jones, Cyrus H. Wheelock, Stephen Markham and many other persons,
who were personally acquainted with the transactions. [1]_--_By the
Historian_. [2]

[Sidenote: The Warning to Flee to the Rocky Mountains.]

_Saturday, June 11, 1844.--_About 9 p.m. Hyrum came out of the Mansion
and gave his hand to Reynolds Cahoon, at the same time saying, "A
company of men are seeking to kill my brother Joseph, and the Lord has
warned him to flee to the Rocky Mountains to save his life. Good-by,
Brother Cahoon, we shall see you again." In a few minutes afterwards
Joseph came from his family. His tears were flowing fast. He held a
handkerchief to his face, and followed after Brother Hyrum without
uttering a word.

Between 9 and 10 p.m. Joseph, Hyrum and Willard, while waiting on the
banks of the river for the skiff, sent {548} for William W. Phelps,
and instructed him to take their families to Cincinnati by the second
steamboat, arriving at Nauvoo; and when he arrived there to commence
petitioning the President of the United States and Congress for redress
of grievances, and see if they would grant the Church liberty and
equal rights. Joseph then said: "Go to our wives, and tell them what
we have concluded to do, and learn their feelings on the subject; and
tell Emma you will be ready to start by the second steamboat, and she
has sufficient money wherewith to pay the expenses. If you ascertain
by tomorrow morning that there is anything wrong, come over the river
to Montrose, to the house of Captain John Killien, and there you will
learn where we are."

About midnight, Joseph, Hyrum and Dr. Richards called for Orrin P.
Rockwell at his lodgings, and all went up the river bank until they
found Aaron Johnson's boat, which they got into, and started about 2 a.
m to cross the Mississippi river. Orrin P. Rockwell rowed the skiff,
which was very leaky, so that it kept Joseph, Hyrum and the doctor busy
baling out the water with their boots and shoes to prevent it from
sinking.

[Sidenote: Preparations for the Western Journey.]

_Sunday, 23.--_At daybreak arrived on the Iowa side of the river. Sent
Orrin P. Rockwell back to Nauvoo with instructions to return the next
night with horses for Joseph and Hyrum, pass them over the river in the
night secretly, and be ready to start for the Great Basin in the Rocky
Mountains.

Joseph, Hyrum and Dr. Richards walked up to Captain John Killien's
house, where they arrived at sunrise; but he not being at home,
they went from thence to Brother William Jordan's. About 9 a.m. Dr.
Bernhisel came over the river to visit Joseph; also Reynolds Cahoon,
who made some explanations respecting Governor Ford's letter.

[Sidenote: Arrival of Constable's _Posse_.]

Early in the morning a _posse_ arrived in Nauvoo to {549} arrest
Joseph, but as they did not find him, they started back to Carthage
immediately, leaving one man of the name of Yates behind them, who said
to one of the brethren that Governor Ford designed that if Joseph and
Hyrum were not given up, he would send his troops and guard the city
until they were found, if it took three years to do it.

[Sidenote: Emma's Message to the Prophet.]

At 1 p.m. Emma sent over Orrin P. Rockwell, requesting him to entreat
of Joseph to come back. Reynolds Cahoon accompanied him with a letter
which Emma had written to the same effect, and she insisted that Cahoon
should persuade Joseph to come back and give himself up. When they went
over they found Joseph, Hyrum and Willard in a room by themselves,
having flour and other provisions on the floor ready for packing.

Reynolds Cahoon informed Joseph what the troops intended to do, and
urged upon him to give himself up, inasmuch as the Governor had pledged
his faith and the faith of the state to protect him while he underwent
a legal and fair trial. Reynolds Cahoon, Lorenzo D. Wasson and Hiram
Kimball accused Joseph of cowardice for wishing to leave the people,
adding that their property would be destroyed, and they left without
house or home. Like the fable, when the wolves came the shepherd ran
from the flock, and left the sheep to be devoured. To which Joseph
replied, "If my life is of no value to my friends it is of none to
myself."

[Sidenote: Consultation with Rockwell.]

Joseph said to Rockwell, "What shall I do?" Rockwell replied, "You are
the oldest and ought to know best; and as you make your bed, I will lie
with you." Joseph then turned to Hyrum, who was talking with Cahoon,
and said, "Brother Hyrum, you are the oldest, what shall we do?" Hyrum
said, "Let us go back and give ourselves up, and see the thing out."
After studying a few moments, Joseph said, "If {550} you go back I will
go with you, but we shall be butchered." Hyrum said, "No, no; let us go
back and put our trust in God, and we shall not be harmed. The Lord is
in it. If we live or have to die, we will be reconciled to our fate."

After a short pause, Joseph told Cahoon to request Captain Daniel C.
Davis to have his boat ready at half-past five to cross them over the
river.

Joseph and Hyrum then wrote the following letter:

    _Letter:--Joseph and Hyrum Smith to Governor Ford--Consenting to go
    to Carthage_.

    BANK OF THE RIVER MISSISSIPPI,

    Sunday, June 23rd, 1844, 2 p.m.

    _His Excellency Governor Ford_:

    SIR.--I wrote you a long communication at 12 last night, expressive
    of my views of your Excellency's communication of yesterday. I
    thought your letter rather severe, but one of my friends has just
    come to me with an explanation from the captain of your _posse_
    which softened the subject matter of your communication, and gives
    us greater assurance of protection, and that your Excellency has
    succeeded in bringing in subjection the spirits which surround your
    Excellency to some extent. And I declare again the only objection I
    ever had or ever made on trial by my country at any time, was what
    I have made in my last letter--on account of assassins, and the
    reason I have to fear deathly consequences from their hands.

    But from the explanation, I now offer to come to you at Carthage
    on the morrow, as early as shall be convenient for your _posse_ to
    escort us into headquarters, provided we can have a fair trial, not
    be abused nor have my witnesses abused, and have all things done in
    due form of law, without partiality, and you may depend on my honor
    without the show of a great armed force to produce excitement in
    the minds of the timid.

    We will meet your _posse,_ if this letter is satisfactory, (if not,
    inform me) at or neat the Mound, at or about two o'clock tomorrow
    afternoon, which will be as soon as we can get our witnesses and
    prepare for trial. We shall expect to take our witnesses with us,
    and not have to wait a subpoena or part at least, so as not to
    detain the proceedings, although we may want time for counsel.

    We remain most respectfully, your Excellency's humble servants,

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    HYRUM SMITH.

{551} Also wrote to Horace T. Hugins, Esquire:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to H. T. Hugins--Engaging Counsel_.

    NAUVOO, Sunday, June 23, 1844.

    _H. T. Hugins, Esq_:

    SIR.--I have agreed to meet Governor Ford at Carthage tomorrow to
    attend an examination before Justice Morrison, and request your
    attendance professionally with the best attorney you can bring.

    I meet the Governor's _posse_ on the Mound at 10 a.m.; in Carthage
    at 12 noon. Do not fail me, and oblige,

    Yours respectfully,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    _per_ W. RICHARDS, Clerk.

    P.S.--Dr. J. R. Wakefield I wish as witness, &c.

And also to Dr. J. Wakefield as follows:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to J. R. Wakefield Soliciting Latter's
    Attendance as Witness_.

    NAUVOO, June 23, 1844.

    _Dr. J. R. Wakefield_:

    SIR.--I would respectfully solicit your attendance at court in
    Carthage tomorrow at 12 noon, as witness in case "State of Illinois
    on complaint of Francis M. Higbee, _versus_ Joseph Smith and
    others." Dear sir, do not fail me, and oblige your old friend,

    JOSEPH SMITH,

    _per_ WILLARD RICHARDS, Clerk.

    P. S.--Esq. Hugins and co-partner are expected. We meet the
    Governor's _posse_ on the Mound at 10 a.m.: at Carthage at 12 noon.
    Bearer will give particulars.

[Sidenote: The Prophet Returns to Nauvoo.]

About 4 p.m. Joseph, Hyrum, the Doctor and others started back. While
walking towards the river, Joseph fell behind with Orrin P. Rockwell.
The other shouted to come on. Joseph replied, "It is of no use to
hurry, for we are going back to be slaughtered," and continually
expressed himself that he would like to get the people once more
together, and talk to them tonight. Rockwell said if that was his
wish he would get the people together, and he could talk to them by
starlight.

{552} It was the strong persuasions of Reynolds Cahoon, Lorenzo D.
Wasson and Hiram Kimball, who were carrying out Emma's instructions,
that induced Joseph and Hyrum to start back to Nauvoo. They re-crossed
the river at half-past five. When they arrived at the Mansion in
Nauvoo, Joseph's family surrounded him, and he tarried there all night,
giving up the idea of preaching to the Saints by starlight.

[Sidenote: Vacillation of Governor Ford.]

He sent the letter of this date to Governor Ford by Col. Theodore
Turley and Elder Jedediah M. Grant, who carried it to Carthage, where
they arrived about 9 p.m. They gave the letter to Governor Ford, who
first agreed to send a _posse_ to escort General Smith in safety to
Carthage. Immediately afterwards Mr. Skinner came in and made a very
bitter speech to the Governor, in which Wilson Law and Joseph H.
Jackson joined, telling him naught but lies, which caused Elder Grant
to ask if messengers to him were to be insulted in that manner. The
Governor treated them coldly, and rescinded his previous promise, and
refused to send or allow an escort to go with Joseph, as he said it
was an honor not given to any other citizen. He would not allow the
messengers to stay in Carthage through the night, but ordered them
to start at 10 o'clock, and return to Nauvoo with orders for General
Smith to be in Carthage at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning without an
escort; and he threatened that if General Smith did not give himself
up at that time, that Nauvoo would be destroyed and all the men, women
and children that were in it. Messrs. Grant and Turley immediately
started; but on account of their horses being wearied, they did not
arrive in Nauvoo until about four a.m. of the 24th, when they went to
General Smith to report to him the state of excitement in Carthage. He
would not hear one word of the warning, as he was determined to go to
Carthage and give himself up to the Governor.

{553} At night Joseph conversed with Captain Anderson, who reported
that the mob at Warsaw had stopped his boat, and threatened to fire
into her with his cannon. He gave the following certificate:

    _Certificate: Captain Anderson--on Retention of People in Nauvoo_.

    NAUVOO, June 23rd, 1844.

    This is to certify that on Tuesday morning last, I stated to
    General Joseph Smith that the number of passengers leaving that day
    might produce the effect on the public mind that they were afraid
    of being attacked, and prove injurious; and I further observed, in
    order to preserve peace and good order, that it would be better to
    use his endeavors to retain those in the city until the excitement
    should abate.

    GEORGE C. ANDERSON,

    Captain steamer _Osprey_.

Joseph received the following letter:

    _Letter: Ed. Johnston to Joseph Smith--About Counsel_.

    Sunday Evening, June 23rd, 1844.

    _General Joseph Smith_:

    SIR.--I have this moment received your favor of this day per the
    hands of Mr. Adams. I regret to say, in reply, that I am now
    awaiting every moment a boat for St. Louis, whither my business
    requires me to go, and which, of course will deter me from acceding
    to your request. I have introduced Mr. Adams to a friend who is
    entirely competent to do full justice to your cause.

    In great haste, yours respectfully,

    ED. JOHNSTON.

    FORT MADISON, IOWA.

[Sidenote: Preparations for Going to Carthage.]

Preparations are making for an early start tomorrow morning for
Carthage. Joseph gave directions to gather some horses for the purpose
of carrying him and his friends to Carthage tomorrow.

Although the Governor has threatened to send his troops into the city,
none have appeared as yet.

[Sidenote: Defendants in the _Expositor_ Case.]

_Monday, 24.--_Francis M. Higbee having sworn out a writ before Thomas
Morrison, a justice of the peace at {554} Carthage on the 11th instant,
against Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Samuel Bennet, John Taylor, William
W. Phelps, John P. Greene, Stephen C. Perry, Dimick B. Huntington,
Jonathan Dunham, Stephen Markham, William W. Edwards, Jonathan Holmes,
Jesse P. Harmon, John Lytle, Joseph W. Coolidge, David Harvey Redfield,
Orrin P. Rockwell and Levi Richards for riot, in destroying the _Nauvoo
Expositor_ press, the property of William and Wilson Law and others,
on the 10th instant, and Governor Ford having sent word by the _posse_
that those eighteen persons should be protected by the militia of the
state, they, upon the assurance of that pledge at half-past six a.m.
started for Carthage, Willard Richards, Dan Jones, Henry G. Sherwood,
Alfred Randall, James Davis, Cyrus H. Wheelock, A. C. Hodge and several
other brethren, together with James W. Woods as counsel, accompanying
them.

[Sidenote: Incidents _en route_ for Carthage.]

When they arrived at the top of the hill, Joseph sent Rockwell with
a horse for Dr. Southwick, a Southern gentleman who had been staying
some days at the Mansion, and who wished General Joseph Smith to buy
considerable property in Texas; but Ed. Bonny took possession of the
horse, so that Dr. Southwick could not then go.

Joseph paused when they got to the Temple, and looked with admiration
first on that, and then on the city, and remarked, "This is the
loveliest place and the best people under the heavens; little do they
know the trials that await them." As he passed out of the city, he
called on Daniel H. Wells, Esq., who was unwell, and on parting he
said, "Squire Wells, I wish you to cherish my memory, and not think me
the worst man in the world either."

[Sidenote: Meeting with Captain Dunn.]

At ten minutes to 10 a.m. they arrived at Albert G. Fellows' farm, four
miles west of Carthage, where they met Captain Dunn with a company
of about sixty mounted militia, on seeing which Joseph said, "Do not
be alarmed, brethren, for they {555} cannot do more to you than the
enemies of truth did to the ancient Saints--they can only kill the
body." The company made a halt, when Joseph, Hyrum and several others
went into Fellows' house with Captain Dunn, who presented an order
from Governor Ford for all the state arms in possession of the Nauvoo
Legion, which Joseph immediately countersigned.

[Sidenote: A Pathetic Prophecy.]

Henry G. Sherwood went up to Joseph and said, "Brother Joseph, shall
I return to Nauvoo and regulate about getting the arms and get the
receipts for them?" Joseph inquired if he was under arrest, or expected
to be arrested. Sherwood answered "No," when Joseph directed him to
return ahead of the company, gather the arms and do as well as he could
in all things. Joseph then said to the company who were with him, _"I
am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's
morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all
men. If they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and my blood
shall cry from the ground for vengeance, and it shall be said of me 'He
was murdered in cold blood!'"_ He then said to Father Sherwood, "Go,
and God bless you." Sherwood then rode as swiftly as he could to Nauvoo.

Esquire Woods left the company there, and continued his journey to
Carthage.

This order for the delivery of the state arms was evidently designed
to drive the citizens of Nauvoo to desperation, so that in the heat of
their indignation they might commit some overt act which the Governor
could construe into treason, and thus have a shadow of excuse for his
mob militia to destroy the Mormons.

[Sidenote: Dunn's Request that the Prophet Return to Nauvoo:]

Captain Dunn requested the company to return to Nauvoo to assist in
collecting the arms, and pledged his word as a military man, that
Joseph and his friends should be protected even if it were at the
expense of his own life, {556} and his men responded to the pledge
by three cheers. Captain Dunn, no doubt feared that the order of the
Governor would excite the inhabitants of Nauvoo beyond endurance, and
therefore chose to depend on the well-known integrity of General Smith
than to risk the chances of exciting the feelings of a much-abused
people. At the same time Joseph sent a messenger to the Governor with
the following letter:

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Governor Ford--Explaining his Return to
    Nauvoo_.

    FOUR MILES WEST OF CARTHAGE MOUND,

    HANCOCK COUNTY, ILLINOIS,

    Monday, 10 o'clock.

    _His Excellency Governor Ford_:

    DEAR SIR.--On my way to Carthage to answer your request this
    morning, I here met Captain Dunn, who has here made known to me
    your orders to surrender the state arms in possession of the Nauvoo
    Legion, which command I shall comply with; and that the same may
    be done properly and without trouble to the state, I shall return
    with Captain Dunn to Nauvoo, see that the arms are put into his
    possession, and shall then return to headquarters in his company,
    when I shall most cheerfully submit to any requisition of the
    Governor of our state.

    With all due respect to your Excellency, I remain your obedient
    servant.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

He also issued the following order:

    _Order: Joseph Smith to General Dunham--Complying with Governor
    Ford's Demand for State Arms_.

    HEADQUARTERS NAUVOO LEGION,

    Prairie Four Miles West of Carthage,

    June 24th, 1844, 10 o'clock and 10 minutes.

    _To Major-General Jonathan Dunham and all commissioned and
    non-commissioned officers and privates of the Nauvoo Legion_:

    You are hereby ordered to comply strictly with the within order of
    the Commander-in-Chief, Governor Ford.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    Lieut.-Gen. Nauvoo Legion.

{557} And requested that the state arms should be taken to the Masonic
Hall without delay.

[Sidenote: Messenger Sent to Carthage.]

Hyrum then said to Abram C. Hodge, "You go on into Carthage and see
what is going on, and hear what is said on this matter."

Joseph and his company then returned with Captain Dunn, and arrived in
Nauvoo at half-past two p.m.

When Hodge arrived at Carthage, he met with Rev. Mr. Dodge, who had
some time previously been very kindly treated by Hyrum. He warned
Hodge that as sure as Joseph and Hyrum came to Carthage, they would be
killed. Hodge also saw Hamilton, the innkeeper, who, pointing to the
Carthage Greys, said, "Hodge, there are the boys that will settle you
Mormons." Hodge replied, "We can take as many men as there are there
out of the Nauvoo Legion, and they would not be missed."

[Sidenote: Surrender of State Arms.]

When the fact of the order for the state arms was known in Nauvoo, many
of the brethren looked upon it as another preparation for a Missouri
massacre, nevertheless, as Joseph requested that it should be complied
with, they very unwillingly gave up the arms.

About 6 p.m., when all the states' arms were collected, and the company
were ready to start, Captain Dunn and Quartermaster-General Buckmaster
made a short speech, expressing their gratitude at the peaceable
conduct of the citizens of Nauvoo, and that while they thus conducted
themselves they would protect them.

It appears that Governor Ford feared that the Nauvoo Legion, although
disbanded, might avenge any outrage that might hereafter be committed
on the persons of their leaders, and so thought he had better disarm
them as he had previously disbanded them; yet the mob was suffered to
retain their portion of the state's arms, even when within a half-day's
march of Nauvoo, and they in a threatening and hostile attitude, while
the Nauvoo Legion had not {558} evinced the least disposition whatever,
except to defend their city in case it should be attacked; and they had
not set a foot outside the limits of the corporation.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Farewell to his Family.]

Joseph rode down home twice to bid his family farewell. He appeared
solemn and thoughtful, and expressed himself to several individuals
that he expected to be murdered. There appeared no alternative but that
he must either give himself up, or the inhabitants of the city would be
massacred by a lawless mob under sanction of the Governor.

[Sidenote: Looking Back-Sadness.]

The company (about fifteen) then started again for Carthage, and when
opposite to the Masonic Hall, Joseph said, "Boys, if I don't come back,
take care of yourselves; I am going like a lamb to the slaughter."
When they passed his farm he took a good look at it, and after they
had passed it, he turned round several times to look again, at which
some of the company made remarks, when Joseph said: "If some of you
had got such a farm and knew you would not see it any more, you would
want to take a good look at it for the last time." When they got to
the edge of the woods near Nauvoo, they met A. C. Hodge returning from
Carthage. He reported to Hyrum what he had heard in Carthage, told him
what his feelings were and said, "Brother Hyrum, you are now clear, and
if it was my duty to counsel you, I would say, do not go another foot,
for they say they will kill you, if you go to Carthage," but as other
persons gathered around, nothing further was said. About this time
Joseph received the following letter:

    _Letter: Messrs. Reid and Woods to Joseph Smith--Documents for
    Defense_.

    CARTHAGE, 5 o'clock p.m.

    _General Joseph Smith_:

    DEAR SIR.--In accordance with previous arrangements with Elder
    Adams, I am here at your service; and it will be necessary for us
    to have, on the examination here before the justice, a certified
    copy of the city ordinance for the destruction of the _Expositor_
    press, or a copy {559} which has been published by authority. We
    also wish the original order issued by you to the marshal for the
    destruction of said press, and such witnesses as may be necessary
    to show by whom the press was destroyed, and that the act was not
    done in a riotous or tumultuous manner.

    Yours respectfully,

    H. T. REID.

    DEAR SIR.--I concur fully as to the above, and will add, from an
    interview with Governor Ford, you can, with the utmost safety,
    rely on his protection, and that you will have as impartial an
    investigation as could be expected from those opposed to you. The
    excitement is much allayed, and your opponents (those who wish to
    make capital out of you) do not want you to come to Carthage. Mr.
    Johnson has gone east, and that will account for Mr. Reed being
    here.

    Respectfully, your obedient servant,

    JAMES W. WOOD.

    CARTHAGE, 24th June, 1844.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Arrival at Carthage.]

The company arrived at Fellows' house, four miles west of Carthage,
about 9 p.m., where they stopped about half an hour, and partook of
such refreshments as they had brought with them. Captain Dunn and his
company of mounted militia, returning with the state arms from Nauvoo,
joined them here, and escorted them into Carthage, where they arrived
at five minutes before 12 at night, and went to Hamilton's tavern.
While passing the public square many of the troops, especially the
Carthage Greys, made use of the following expressions, which were
re-echoed in the ears of the Governor and hundreds of others, "Where is
the damned prophet?" "Stand away, you McDonough boys, and let us shoot
the damned Mormons." "G--d--you, old Joe, we've got you now." "Clear
the way and let us have a view of Joe Smith, the prophet of God. He has
seen the last of Nauvoo. We'll use him up now, and kill all the damned
Mormons." The rear platoon of the Carthage Greys repeatedly threw their
guns over their heads in a curve, so that the bayonets struck the
ground with the breech of their guns upward, when {560} they would run
back and pick them up, at the same time whooping, yelling, hooting and
cursing like a pack of savages.

[Sidenote: The Governor Pacifies the Mob.]

On hearing the above expressions, the Governor put his head out of
the window and very fawningly said, "I know your great anxiety to see
Mr. Smith, which is natural enough, but it is quite too late tonight
for you to have the opportunity; but I assure you, gentlemen, you
shall have that privilege tomorrow morning, as I will cause him to
pass before the troops upon the square, and I now wish you, with this
assurance, quietly and peaceably to return to your quarters." When this
declaration was made, there was a faint "Hurrah for Tom Ford," and they
instantly obeyed his wish.

[Sidenote: The Apostates at Carthage.]

There was a company of apostates also quartered at Hamilton's
hotel--namely William and Wilson Law, the Higbees and Fosters,
Augustine Spencer, Henry O. Norton, John A. Hicks, (formerly president
of the Elder's quorum) and others. Hicks stated to C. H. Wheelock
that it was determined to shed the blood of Joseph Smith by not only
himself, but by the Laws, Higbees, Fosters, Joseph H. Jackson, and many
others, whether he was cleared by the law or not. Jackson talked freely
and unreservedly on that subject, as though he were discoursing upon
the most common occurrence of his life. Said he, you will find me a
true prophet in this respect. Wheelock told Ford what Hicks had said,
but he treated it with perfect indifference, and suffered Hicks and his
associates to run at liberty and mature their murderous plans.

A writ was also issued by Robert F. Smith against Joseph W. Coolidge
on complaint of Chauncey L. Higbee, charging him with the illegal
detention of Charles A. Foster.

CHAPTER XXIX.

ARREST OF JOSEPH AND HYRUM SMITH ON A CHARGE OF TREASON--FALSE
IMPRISONMENT--ELDER TAYLOR'S PROTEST--FALSE IMPRISONMENT.

[Sidenote: The Governor's Pledge of Protection.]

_Tuesday, June 25, 1844.--_This morning the prisoners voluntarily
surrendered themselves to the constable, Mr. Bettisworth, who held the
writ against them. The Governor was at headquarters in person, and had
pledged his own faith and the faith of the state of Illinois, that the
Smiths and other persons should be protected from personal violence,
and should have a fair and impartial trial, if they would surrender
themselves to be dealt with according to law. During the Governor's
stay in Carthage, he repeatedly expressed to the legal counselors of
the Smiths his determination to protect the prisoners, and to see that
they should have a fair and impartial examination.

[Sidenote: The Arrest for Treason.]

At 8 a.m. President Smith had an interview with William G. Flood of
Quincy, U. S. Receiver of Public Moneys. While in conversation with
him, Constable David Bettisworth arrested Joseph for treason against
the state of Illinois, with the following writ, which had been granted
on the oath of Augustine Spencer:

    _Writ of Arrest on the Charge of Treason--Joseph Smith_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    CITY OF NAUVOO. ss

    _The people of the State of Illinois, to all sheriffs, coroners and
    constables of said state greeting_:

    Whereas complaint has been made before me, one of the justices of
    {562} the peace in and for said county aforesaid, upon the oath of
    Augustine Spencer, that Joseph Smith, late of the county aforesaid,
    did, on or about the nineteenth day of June. A. D. 1844, at the
    county and state aforesaid, commit the crime of treason against the
    government and people of the State of Illinois aforesaid.

    These are therefore to command you to take the said Joseph Smith
    if he be found in your county, or if he shall have fled, that you
    pursue after the said Smith into another county within this state,
    and take and safely keep the said Joseph Smith, so that you have
    his body forthwith before me to answer the said complaint and be
    further dealt with according to law.

    [Seal]

    Given under my hand and seal this 24th day of June, A. D. 1844.

    R. F. SMITH, J. P.

Hyrum Smith was also arrested at the same time for treason on the same
writ, granted on the affidavit of Henry O. Norton:

    _Writ of Arrest for Treason--Hyrum Smith_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY. ss

    _The people of the State of Illinois, to all sheriffs, coroners and
    constables, greeting_:

    Whereas complaint has been made before me, one of the justices
    of the peace, in and for the county of Hancock, upon the oath of
    one Henry O. Norton, that one Hyrum Smith, late of the county of
    Hancock and state of Illinois, did, on the 19th day of June, 1844,
    commit the crime of treason against the government and people of
    the state of Illinois aforesaid.

    These are therefore to command you to take the body of the said
    Hyrum Smith, if he be found in your county, or if he shall have
    fled that you pursue after the said Hyrum Smith into any county
    within this state, and take and safely keep the said Hyrum Smith,
    so that you have his body forthwith before me, to answer unto the
    said complaint, and be further dealt with according to law.

    Given under my hand and seal, this 24th day of June. 1844.

    R. F. SMITH, J. P.

[Sidenote: Governor Ford's Speech to the Troops.]

_8:30 a.m.--_Governor Ford called all the troops and ordered them to
form a hollow square on the public ground near the Court House; and
when formed, he {563} mounted an old table, and addressed them in a
most inflammatory manner, exciting the feelings of indignation against
Generals Joseph and Hyrum Smith which were already burning in their
breasts, occasioned by the falsehoods and misrepresentations that were
in circulation, giving his assent and sanction to the rumors that had
gathered them together, and stating that although they were dangerous
men in the community, and guilty of all that they might have alleged
against them, still they were in the hands of the law, which must have
its course. He continued speaking twenty or thirty minutes.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Request for an Interview with Gov. Ford.]

_9:15 a.m.--_The Governor came in and invited Joseph to walk with
him through the troops. Joseph solicited a few moments, private
conversation with him, which the Governor refused. While refusing, the
Governor looked down at his shoes, as though he was ashamed. They then
walked through the crowd with Brigadier-General Miner R. Deming and Dr.
Richards, to General Deming's quarters. The people appeared quiet until
a company of Carthage Greys flocked around the doors of General Deming
in an uproarious manner, of which notice was sent to the Governor. In
the meantime the Governor had ordered the McDonough troops to be drawn
up in line for Joseph and Hyrum to pass in front of them, they having
requested that they might have a clear view of the Generals Smith.
Joseph had a conversation with the Governor for about ten minutes, when
he again pledged the faith of the state that he and his friends should
be protected from violence.

Robinson, the postmaster, said, on report of martial law being
proclaimed in Nauvoo, he had stopped the mail and notified the
Postmaster-General of the state of things in Hancock county.

[Sidenote: The Prophet Presented to the Troops.]

From the General's quarters Joseph and Hyrum went in front of the
lines, in a hollow square of a company of {564} Carthage Greys. At
seven minutes before ten they arrived in front of the lines, and passed
before the whole, Joseph being on the right of General Deming, and
Hyrum on his left, Elders Richards, Taylor and Phelps following. Joseph
and Hyrum were introduced by the Governor about twenty times along the
line, as General Joseph Smith and General Hyrum Smith, the Governor
walking in front on the left. The Carthage Greys refused to receive
them by that introduction, and some of the officers threw up their
hats drew their swords and said they would introduce themselves to the
damned Mormons in a different style. The Governor mildly entreated them
not to act so rudely, but their excitement increased. The Governor,
however, succeeded in pacifying them by making a speech, and promising
them that they should have "full satisfaction." General Smith and party
returned to their lodgings at five minutes past ten.

[Sidenote: Revolt of the Carthage Greys.]

_10:30.--_News reached Joseph at the hotel that the Carthage Greys had
revolted, and were put under guard by General Deming. Joseph told all
his friends to stay in the two rooms occupied by them in the hotel.

_10:50.--_Quietness was apparently restored among the Carthage Greys.

_11:15.--_News arrived that the Warsaw troops were near Carthage, and
had come of their own accord.

Mr. Prentice, U. S. Marshal for Illinois, called to see Joseph.

[Sidenote: Threats of Apostates to Plunder Nauvoo.]

_12 minutes before 1.--_Intelligence was given to Joseph that the
Laws, Higbees, Fosters and others, were going to Nauvoo to plunder. To
Governor called at the door with some gentlemen, when Joseph informed
him of what he had heard, and requested him to send a guard to protect
the city of Nauvoo.

Willard Richards wrote a letter to his wife.

{565} _1:30 p.m.--_After dinner, Mark Aldrich of Warsaw called to see
Joseph.

_2:30.--_The Governor communicated that he had ordered Captain
Singleton with a company of men from McDonough county, to march to
Nauvoo to co-operate with the police in keeping the peace; and he would
call out the Legion, if necessary.

Joseph wrote to Emma as follows:

    _Letter: The Prophet to Emma Smith--Governor Ford Going to Nauvoo_.

    CARTHAGE, June 25th, 1844.

    2:30 o'clock p.m.

    DEAR EMMA.--I have had an interview with Governor Ford, and he
    treats us honorably. Myself and Hyrum have been again arrested for
    treason because we called out the Nauvoo Legion; but when the truth
    comes out we have nothing to fear. We all feel calm and composed.

    This morning Governor Ford introduced myself and Hyrum to the
    militia in a very appropriate manner, as General Joseph Smith and
    General Hyrum Smith. There was a little mutiny among the Carthage
    Greys, but I think the Governor has and will succeed in enforcing
    the laws. I do hope the people of Nauvoo will continue pacific and
    prayerful.

    Governor Ford has just concluded to send some of his militia to
    Nauvoo to protect the citizens, and I wish that they may be kindly
    treated. They will co-operate with the police to keep the peace.
    The Governor's orders will be read in the hearing of the police and
    officers of the Legion, as I suppose.

    _3 o'clock.--_The Governor has just agreed to march his army to
    Nauvoo, and I shall come along with him. The prisoners, all that
    can, will be admitted to bail. I am as ever,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    EMMA SMITH.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Warning to Rockwell.]

Joseph also sent a message to Orrin P. Rockwell not to come to
Carthage, but to stay in Nauvoo, and not to suffer himself to be
delivered into the hands of his enemies, or to be taken a prisoner by
any one.

It was reported by Israel Barlow that he had heard resolutions of the
Warsaw troops read, to the effect that they would return to Warsaw at 3
p.m., then go to Golden's Point on Thursday, and thence to Nauvoo.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Interview with Militia Officers.]

{566}

Several of the officers of the troops in Carthage, and other gentlemen,
curious to see the Prophet, visited Joseph in his room. General Smith
asked them if there was anything in his appearance that indicated he
was the desperate character his enemies represented him to be; and
he asked them to give him their honest opinion on the subject. The
reply was, "No, sir, your appearance would indicate the very contrary,
General Smith; but we cannot see what is in your heart, neither can we
tell what are your intentions." To which Joseph replied, "Very true,
gentlemen, you cannot see what is in my heart, and you are therefore
unable to judge me or my intentions; but I can see what is in your
hearts, and will tell you what I see. I can see that you thirst for
blood, and nothing but my blood will satisfy you. It is not for
crime of any description that I and my brethren are thus continually
persecuted and harassed by our enemies, but there are other motives,
and some of them I have expressed, so far as relates to myself; and
inasmuch as you and the people thirst for blood, I prophesy, in the
name of the Lord, that you shall witness scenes of blood and sorrow to
your entire satisfaction. Your souls shall be perfectly satiated with
blood, and many of you who are now present shall have an opportunity to
face the cannon's mouth from sources you think not of; and those people
that desire this great evil upon me and my brethren, shall be filled
with regret and sorrow because of the scenes of desolation and distress
that await them. They shall seek for peace, and shall not be able to
find it. Gentlemen, you will find what I have told you to be true."

_12 minutes to 4.--_Report came to Joseph that William and Wilson Law,
Robert D. Foster, Chauncey L. Higbee and Francis M. Higbee had said
_that there was nothing against these men; the law could not reach them
but powder and ball would,_ and they should not go out of Carthage
alive.

[Sidenote: Arraigned on the _Expositor_ Affair.]

{567}

Joseph, Hyrum and thirteen others, were taken before Robert F. Smith, a
justice of the peace residing in Carthage (he being also captain of the
Carthage Greys) on the charge of riot destroying the printing press of
the _Nauvoo Expositor_.

It is worthy of notice here, that when the defendants went before
Esquire Wells, the prosecution objected, and insisted that they should
be taken before the justice who issued the writ--viz., Thomas Morrison,
and that Governor Ford had also stated in his letter to General Joseph
Smith that he must go before the justice in Carthage who issued the
writ. But when the prosecution had the defendants in their own power
in Carthage, they could then ride over their own objections by taking
them before another justice, who was known to be a greater enemy to
the defendants than Justice Morrison, and moreover, before one who was
not only a justice of the peace, but also the Military commander of a
company of Carthage Greys, who had already been arrested for mutiny.

Chauncey L. Higbee, one of the prosecutors, moved an adjournment.

H. T. Reid and James W. Woods on behalf of the defendants, objected
to an adjournment, and said that the court was not authorized to
take recognizance without their acknowledging their guilt, or having
witnesses to prove it, and we admit the press was destroyed by order of
the Mayor, it having been condemned by the City Council as a nuisance.

They read law to show that justices could not recognize without
admission of guilt, and offered to give bail.

Mr. Reid stated that the law quoted by the prosecution belonged to
civil, not criminal cases.

The prosecution insisted to have a commission of the crime acknowledged.

[Sidenote: Prophet_ et. al_. Bound over to Circuit Court.]

After a good deal of resistance on the part of the prosecution, court
asked if the parties admitted that there was {568} sufficient cause
to bind over, and the counsel for the defense admitted there was,
and offered to enter into cognizance in the common form, in order to
prevent, if possible, any increase of excitement.

[Sidenote: The Sureties for the Prophet.]

_5 p.m.--_Court acknowledged the admission and ordered recognizances,
whereupon Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, John Taylor, William M. Phelps,
John P. Greene, Stephen C. Perry, Dimick B. Huntington, Jonathan
Dunham, Stephen Markham, Jonathan H. Holmes, Jesse P. Harmon, John
Lytle, Joseph W. Coolidge, David Harvey Redfield, and Levi Richards
gave bonds, with John S. Fullmer, Edward Hunter, Dan Jones, John
Benbow, and other unexceptionable sureties, in the sum of $500 for each
of the defendants, total $7,500, for their appearance at the next term
of the Circuit Court for Hancock county.

It was evident that the magistrate intended to overreach the wealth
of the defendants and their friends, so as to imprison them for want
of bail; but it happened that there was strength to cover the demand,
for some of the brethren went security to the full extent of their
property; and Justice Smith adjourned his court over, and left the
court house without calling on Joseph and Hyrum to answer to the charge
of treason, or even intimating to those prisoners, or their counsel
that they were expected to enter into an examination that night.

Captain Smith, the only magistrate who could grant subpoenas for
witnesses, disappeared until a late hour, as if purposely to prevent
the appearing of the defendant's witnesses, and in keeping with the
conviction expressed by Joseph's enemies the previous day, that the law
cannot touch them, but that powder and bail will.

[Sidenote: Another Warrant Sought--Daniel's Kingdom and Treason.]

_About 6:30 p.m.--_Dan Jones heard Wilson Law, whilst endeavoring to
get another warrant against Joseph Smith for treason, declare that
while he (Mr. Smith) was once preaching from Daniel 2nd chapter, 44th
verse, said that the {569} kingdom referred to was already set up, and
that he was the king over it. He also heard Joseph H. Jackson, and
other leaders of the mob, declare that they had eighteen accusations
against Joseph and as one failed, they would try another to detain him
there, and that they had had so much trouble and hazard, and worked so
hard in getting him to Carthage, that they would not let him get out of
it alive. Jackson pointed to his pistols and said, "The balls are in
there that will decide his case." Jones immediately went up stairs to
Joseph and informed him what he had heard Jackson say.

_About 7:30 p.m.--_Dr. Levi Richards and most of the brethren, after
they had signed the bonds, left for Nauvoo when Joseph and Hyrum
went into the Governor's room and spoke with him, as Governor Ford
had promised them an interview. After a few moments' conversation,
the Governor left them to order the captain of the guard to give the
brethren some passes. They then went to supper.

[Sidenote: Illegal Imprisonment of the Smith Brothers.]

_8 p.m.--_Constable Bettisworth appeared at the lodgings of Joseph and
Hyrum, and insisted that they should go to jail. Joseph demanded a copy
of the mittimus, which was refused. Messrs. Woods and Reid, as counsel,
insisted that the prisoners were entitled to be brought before a
justice of the peace for examination before they could be sent to jail.
The constable, to their surprise, then exhibited the following mittimus:

    _The False Mittimus_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY, ss.

    _The people of the State of Illinois to the keeper of the jail of
    said County, Greeting_:

    Whereas Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith, of the county aforesaid, have
    been arrested upon oath of Augustine Spencer and Henry O. Norton,
    for the crime of treason, and have been brought before me as {570}
    a justice of the peace in and for the said county, for trial at the
    seat of justice thereof, which trial has been necessarily postponed
    by reason of the absence of the material witnesses--to wit, Francis
    M. Higbee and others. Therefore, I command you, in the name of the
    people, to receive the said Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith into your
    custody in the jail of the county aforesaid, there so remain until
    discharged by due course of law.

    [Seal]

    Given under my hand and seal this 25th day of June, A. D. 1843.

    (Signed)

    R. F. SMITH J. P.

Joseph remonstrated against such bare-faced, illegal, and tyrannical
proceedings, but the constable still insisted that they should go to
jail. Lawyer Woods requested the officer to wait until he could see
Governor Ford, and was told by Bettisworth that he could only wait five
minutes.

[Sidenote: Governor Ford Refuses to Interfere with Illegal Proceedings.]

Joseph and Hyrum again remonstrated, and the constable waited until
about nine o'clock, when they heard by Mr. Wood that the Governor did
not think it within the sphere of his duty to interfere, as they were
in the hands of the civil law, and therefore he had not the power to
stay process, of the due course of law, and that he could not interrupt
a civil officer in the discharge of his duty.

Governor Ford knew this [proceeding] was illegal, (for he had formerly
been an associate-justice of the Supreme Court of the state) and when
he was appealed to by Captain Robert F. Smith to know what he must do,
as he had found his mittimus as a magistrate was illegal, and therefore
that it was a false committal, Governor Ford replied, "You have the
Carthage Greys at your command."_ Captain Smith_ therefore commanded
his "Greys" to execute and carry into effect his illegal mittimus as
a _magistrate,_ thus practically blending the civil and military in
the same person at the same time; and the prisoners were violently and
illegally dragged to jail without any examination whatever, while his
Excellency was in the adjoining room from that from which they {571}
were thus taken. So much for his professions that _the law must be
executed_.

Thus a justice of the peace acting as a military officer also by virtue
of his commission as such, orders his command to appear under arms
and to incarcerate the prisoners whom he had just before ordered to
commit to jail by_ mittimus without having them brought before him for
examination;_ and the Governor, having been himself at one time a judge
upon the bench, knew and well understood the illegality of the above
proceedings.

He also well knew that military power and [civil] authority had been
used by one and the same person, and yet he, acting at that time
as Commander-in-Chief, which gave him the supervision over all his
officers, and in fact made him responsible for all their acts and
movements, refused to interfere when requested by the prisoners to
interpose his authority in their behalf against an illegal civil
process, and also refused to countermand the illegal, oppressive and
unofficer-like order of one of his captains.

Moreover, having taken the oath of office, as Governor of the state
of Illinois, he was by virtue of that oath bound to see the laws
faithfully executed, and not, as in this instance, see them violated
and trodden under foot, and even prompt one of his officers in his
lawless course. Thus he violated his solemn pledges and oath of office.

[Sidenote: Elder Taylor's Remonstrance with Governor Ford.]

Elder John Taylor says, "As I was informed of this illegal proceeding,
I went immediately to the Governor and informed him of it; whether he
was apprized of it before or not I do not know, but my opinion is that
he was. I represented to him the character of the parties who had made
oath, the outrageous nature of the charge, the indignity offered to men
in the position which they [the prisoners] occupied, and that he knew
very well that it was a vexatious prosecution, and that they were not
guilty of any such thing."

The Governor replied that he was very sorry that the {572} thing had
occurred; that he did not believe the charges, but that he thought that
the best thing to be done in the premises was to let the law take its
course.

"I then reminded him that we had come out there at his instance, not to
satisfy the law, which we had done before, but the prejudices of the
people in relation to the affair of the press; that we had given bonds,
which we could not by law be required to do, to satisfy the people at
his instance, and that it was asking too much to require gentlemen in
their position in life to suffer the degradation of being immured in a
jail at the instance of such worthless scoundrels as those who had made
this affidavit.

"The Governor replied that it was an unpleasant affair, and looked
hard, but that it was a matter over which he had no control, as
it belonged to the judiciary; that he, as the executive could not
interfere with their proceedings, and that he had no doubt but that
they would be immediately dismissed.

"I told him that we had looked to him for protection from such insults,
and that I thought we had a right to do so from the solemn promises
he had made to me and Dr. Bernhisel in relation to our coming without
a guard or arms; that we had relied upon his faith and had a right to
expect him to fulfill his engagements, after we had placed ourselves
implicitly under his care, and complied with all his requests, although
extra-judicial.

"He replied that he would detail a guard, if we required it, and see us
protected, but that he could not interfere with the judiciary.

"I expressed my dissatisfaction at the course taken, and told him that
if we were to be subject to mob rule, and to be dragged contrary to law
into prison, at the instance of every infernal scoundrel whose oath
could be bought for a dram of whiskey, his protection availed very
little, and we had miscalculated his promises.

"Seeing there was no prospect of redress from the Governor, I returned
to the room and found the Constable, {573} Bettisworth, very urgent to
hurry Brothers Joseph and Hyrum to prison, whilst the brethren were
remonstrating with him.

"At the same time a great rabble was gathered in the streets and around
the door, and from the rowdyism manifested, I was afraid there was a
design to murder the prisoners on the way to the jail.

[Sidenote: Elder Taylor Takes Independent Action.]

"Without conferring with any person, my next feeling was to procure a
guard, and seeing a man habited as a soldier in the room, I went to
him and said, "I am afraid there is a design against the lives of the
Messrs. Smith, will you go immediately and bring your captain, and if
not convenient, any other captain of a company, and I will pay you well
for your trouble."

"He said he would, and departed forthwith, and soon returned with his
captain, whose name I have forgotten [1] and introduced him to me.

"I told him of my fears, and requested him immediately to fetch his
company. He departed forthwith, and arrived at the door with them, just
as the time that the constable was hurrying the brethren downstairs.

"A number of brethren went along, and one or two strangers, and all of
us safely lodged in prison, remained there during the night."

As Esquire Woods went to the door he met Captain Dunn, with some
twenty men, they having come to guard the prisoners in jail. Mr.
Woods accompanied Governor Ford to (Captain) Justice Robert F. Smith,
who gave as a cause for issuing the warrant of committal, that the
prisoners were not personally safe at the hotel. Mr. Woods then
requested the Governor to have a company of troops from some other
county detailed to guard the jail.

[Sidenote: In Carthage Jail.]

Captain Dunn, with his company, escorted Joseph and {574} Hyrum Smith
from their lodgings, together with Willard Richards, John Taylor, John
P. Greene, Stephen Markham, Dan Jones, John S. Fullmer, Dr. Southwick,
and Lorenzo D. Wasson, to the jail. Markham had a very large hickory
cane, which he called "the rascal-beater." Dan Jones had a smaller
walking-stick, and they walked on either side of Joseph and Hyrum,
keeping off the drunken rabble, who several times broke through the
ranks.

They were received by the jailer, Mr. George W. Stigall, and put
into the criminal's cell; but he afterwards gave them the debtors'
apartment, where the prisoners and their friends had amusing
conversations on various interesting subjects, which engaged them till
late. Prayer was offered, which made Carthage prison into the gate of
heaven for a while. They laid promiscuously on the floor, where they
all slept from 11:30 until 6 a.m. of the 26th.

Counselor H. T. Reid, in his published statement, writes as follows:
"The recitals of the mittimus, so far as they relate to the prisoners,
having been brought before the justice for trial, and it there
appearing that the necessary witnesses of the prosecution were absent,
are wholly untrue, unless the prisoners could have appeared before the
justice, without being present in person or by counsel; nor is there
any law of Illinois which permits a justice to commit persons charged
with crimes to jail, without examination as to the probability of their
guilt."

Footnotes:

1. This was Captain Dunn, of Augusta township, who had been sent to
Nauvoo a few days before to collect the state arms at Nauvoo, and who
afterwards escorted the Prophet and his friends into Carthage.

CHAPTER XXX.

INTERVIEW IN CARTHAGE PRISON BETWEEN GOVERNOR FORD AND THE
PROPHET--TAYLOR'S REPORT OF THE INTERVIEW--TESTIMONY TO THE EXISTENCE
OF A CARTHAGE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE.

_Wednesday, June 26, 1844; 7 a.m.--_Joseph, Hyrum, and the rest of the
brethren, took breakfast with Stigall, and were then removed to the
room upstairs.

Dr. Southwick went to see the Governor.

[Sidenote: Messages to the Governor]

_At 7:30 a.m.,_ Markham, Wasson, and Jones were severally sent by
Joseph with messages to the Governor, but at 8 a.m., got no return.
He also sent word to his counsel that he wanted a change of venue to
Quincy, Adams County.

_At 8 a.m.,_ Joseph and Hyrum had a conversation with the jailor, Mr.
Stigall, who said a week last Wednesday the mob were calculating to
have made an attack on Nauvoo, and they expected about 9000 persons,
but only about 200 came. They had sent runners to Missouri, and all
around the counties in Illinois.

_At ten minutes past 8 o'clock a.m._ Joseph wrote to Governor Ford, as
follows and sent it by Mr. Stigall:--

    _Letter--Joseph Smith to Governor Ford--Soliciting an Interview_.

    CARTHAGE JAIL, June 26, 1844.

    Ten minutes past 8 a.m.

    _His Excellency Governor Ford_:

    SIR.--I would again solicit your excellency for an interview having
    been much disappointed the past evening. I hope you will not
    deny me this privilege any longer than your public duties shall
    absolutely require.

    {576} We have been committed under a false mittimus, and
    consequently the proceedings are illegal, and we desire the time
    may be hastened when all things shall be made right, and we
    relieved from this imprisonment.

    Your servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    P. S.--Please send an answer per bearer.

[Sidenote: Word from Governor Ford.]

_At 8:30 a.m.,_ Markham and Jones returned, stating that the Governor
said he was taken by surprise last evening, and was very sorry. Was
afraid we would think he had forfeited his word about having an
interview, that the wrath of the people was about to turn on the head
of Jackson, the mob, &c. That the Governor was doing as fast as he
could.

_Twelve minutes before 9._ Received the following reply on the same
sheet:--

    "The interview will take place at my earliest leisure to-day.

    "GOVERNOR FORD."

[Sidenote: Consultation with Counsel]

_Ten minutes to 9._ Mr. Reid and others arrived at the jail and
investigated the merits of the case, and concluded to take a change
of venue before Justice Greenleaf, of Augusta, Hancock county, and
to send for Dr. James H. Lyon, Col. J. Brewer, Edward Bonney, M. G.
Eaton, Dr. Abiathar Williams, Thomas A. Lyne, George J. Adams, Dr. J.
M. Bernhisel, Daniel H. Wells, Daniel Spencer, Orson Spencer, Dr. J.
R. Wakefield, George P. Stiles, Jonathan Dunham, Albert P. Rockwood,
Captain G. C. Anderson, William Marks, Hiram Kimball, Lorenzo D.
Wasson, and Samuel Searles, as witnesses.

[Sidenote: Interview with Gov. Ford.]

_9:27 a.m._ The Governor, in company with Col. Thomas Geddes, arrived
at the jail, when a lengthy conversation was entered into in relation
to our difficulties; and after some preliminary remarks, at the
Governor's request Brother Joseph gave him a general outline of the
state of the country, {577} the tumultuous, mobocratic movements of our
enemies, the precautionary measures used by himself, (Joseph Smith) the
acts of the City Council, the destruction of the press, and the moves
of the mob and ourselves up to that time.

    _The Following Account of this Interview is from the Manuscript
    History of the Church in the Historian's Office, and not Hitherto
    Published_.

    Joseph Smith stated to them [Governor Ford and Col. Geddes] the
    origin of the difficulty, the facts relating to the _Expositor_
    press, the course pursued by the City Council; the legality, as
    they thought, of their legislation; the pledges that he had made by
    letter and sent by expresses to his Excellency, that he was willing
    to satisfy all legal claims in case it should be shown that the
    City Council had transcended their legal bounds, etc., and that
    the Legion had been called out for the protection of the city,
    while it was threatened with immediate hostilities by an infuriated
    mob, until his Excellency could afford relief, and not for the
    purpose of invasion. (The Governor seemed to be satisfied that this
    was the truth, but still he did not interfere in their illegal
    imprisonment). Joseph adverted to all the leading causes which
    gave rise to the difficulties under consideration in a brief, but
    lucid, energetic and impressive manner. The Governor said he was
    satisfied it was the truth. General Smith then read copies of the
    orders and proceedings of the City Council of Nauvoo, concerning
    the destruction of the _Expositor_ press, and of the correspondence
    forwarded to his Excellency, in relation thereto; and also informed
    him concerning the calling out of the Legion, and the position they
    occupied of absolute necessity, not to make war upon, or invade the
    rights of any portion of the citizens of the State; but it was the
    _last resort,_ and _only_ defense_, in the absence of executive
    protection,_ against a large, organized military and mobocratic foe.

    General Smith reminded his Excellency that the question in dispute
    [the _Expositor_ case] was a _civil_ matter, and to settle which
    needed no resort to arms, and that he was ready at any time, and
    had always been ready to answer any charge that might be preferred
    against him, either as the Lieutenant General of the Legion, the
    Mayor of the City, or as a private individual, in any court of
    justice, which was unintimidated by a mob or military array_, and
    make all the satisfaction that the law required, if any, etc._ The
    Governor said he had not called out this force; [i. e., {578} the
    one then gathered at Carthage] but found it assembled in military
    array, without his orders, on his arrival at Carthage, and that the
    laws _must be enforced,_ but that the prisoners must and should be
    protected, and he again pledged his word, and the faith and honor
    of the State, that they should be protected. He also stated that he
    intended to march his forces (that is, those who had assembled for
    mobocratic purposes; and whom he had mustered into his service) to
    Nauvoo to gratify_ them,_ and that the prisoners should accompany
    them, and then return again to attend the trial before the said
    magistrate, which he said had been postponed for the purpose of
    making this visit. (John S. Fullmer) Joseph alluded to the coming
    of Constable Bettisworth when he gave himself up, also to his offer
    to go before_ any other justice of the peace,_ and called upon some
    twenty bystanders to witness that he submitted to the writ, but
    for fear of his life if he went to Carthage he had preferred to go
    before Esq. Daniel H. Wells, a gentleman of high legal attainments,
    who is in no way connected with the Mormon Church.

    Joseph also said that he had sent frequent expresses and letters
    to the Governor; that Dr. J. R. Wakefield, Dr. J. M. Bernhisel and
    Mr. Sidney Rigdon also had written letters to the Governor; that he
    had written another letter to the Governor which was sent on the
    15th of June by Mr. James; that he had written again on the 16th of
    June, enclosing affidavits, and sent them by Messrs. Edward Hunter,
    Phillip B. Lewis and John Bills. He also read Captain Anderson's
    certificate of the proceedings of the mob at Warsaw; also his
    Proclamation, his orders as Lieutenant General to Major General
    Dunham, the proceedings of the City Council of Nauvoo, and copies
    of communications forwarded to Springfield; also his letter of the
    21st of June which was sent by Dr. Bernhisel, and Mr. John Taylor,
    and his letter of the 22nd, which was sent by Lucien Woodworth and
    Squire Woods.

    Marshal John P. Greene explained about giving passes to persons
    going in and out of the city, and denied that any arrests had been
    made.

    The Governor referred to the trial before Esq. Wells, which did
    not satisfy the feelings of the people in and about Carthage.
    The Governor admitted that sufficient time had not been allowed
    by the posse for the defendants to get ready, or to gather their
    witnesses, said it can be very safely admitted that your statements
    are true, and was satisfied now that the people of Nauvoo had acted
    according to the best of their judgment.

    Mr. Reid said that it was very evident from the excitement created
    by Mr. Smith's enemies it would have been unsafe for him to come
    to Carthage, for under such circumstances he could not have had an
    impartial trial.

    {579} The Governor said he came here to enforce the laws on all
    the people whether Mormons or not; and then expressed his feelings
    about the destruction of the _Expositor_ press.

    Joseph spoke of his imprisonment in Missouri, and of the shameful
    kidnapping of his witnesses, and their being thrust into prison to
    prevent them from giving their testimony in his favor.

    Governor Ford spoke of the Constitution.

    Joseph said we were willing to pay for the press, as he did not
    want the owners to suffer any loss by it, [i. e. its suppression]
    neither did he wish such a libelous paper to be published in
    Nauvoo. As for calling out the Nauvoo Legion, if it was intended to
    resist the government of the State, it would be treason; but, as
    they believed, they were endeavoring to defend themselves, and had
    no such intention as to resist the government--it was all right.

The following report is by Elder John Taylor. [1]

    _Elder John Taylor's Account of Governor Ford's and President
    Smith's Interview_.

    _Governor--_General Smith, I believe you have given me a general
    outline of the difficulties that have existed in the country, in
    the documents forwarded to me by Dr. Bernhisel and Mr. Taylor;
    but, unfortunately, there seems to be a discrepancy between
    your statements and those of your enemies. It is true that you
    are substantiated by evidence and affidavit, but for such an
    extraordinary excitement as that which is now in the country,
    there must be some cause, and I attribute the last outbreak to
    the destruction of the_ Expositor,_ and to your refusal to comply
    with the writ issued by Esq. Morrison. The press in the United
    States is looked upon as the great bulwark of American freedom,
    and its destruction in Nauvoo was represented and looked upon as
    a high-handed measure, and manifests to the people a disposition
    {580} on your part to suppress the liberty of speech and of the
    press; this, with your refusal to comply with the requisition of a
    writ, I conceive to be the principal cause of this difficulty, and
    you are, moreover, represented to me as turbulent and defiant of
    the laws and institutions of your country.

    _Gen. Smith.--_Governor Ford, you, sir, as Governor of this State,
    are aware of the prosecutions and persecutions that I have endured.
    You know well that our course has been peaceable and law-abiding,
    for I have furnished this State, ever since our settlement here,
    with sufficient evidence of my pacific intentions, and those of
    the people with whom I am associated, by the endurance of every
    conceivable indignity and lawless outrage perpetrated upon me
    and upon this people since our settlement here, and you yourself
    know that I have kept you well posted in relation to all matters
    associated with the late difficulties. If you have not got some of
    my communications, it has not been my fault.

    Agreeably to your orders, I assembled the Nauvoo Legion for the
    protection of Nauvoo and the surrounding country against an armed
    band of marauders, and ever since they have been mustered I have
    almost daily communicated with you in regard to all the leading
    events that have transpired; and whether in the capacity of mayor
    of the city; or lieutenant-general of the Nauvoo Legion, I have
    striven to preserve the peace and administer even-handed justice
    to all; but my motives are impugned, my acts are misconstrued, and
    I am grossly and wickedly misrepresented. I suppose I am indebted
    for my incarceration here to the oath of a worthless man that was
    arraigned before me and fined for abusing and maltreating his lame,
    helpless brother.

    That I should be charged by you, sir, who know better, of acting
    contrary to law, is to me a matter of surprise. Was it the Mormons
    or our enemies who first commenced these difficulties? You know
    well it was not us; and when this turbulent, outrageous people
    commenced their insurrectionary movements, I made you acquainted
    with them, officially, and asked your advice, and have followed
    strictly your counsel in every particular.

    Who ordered out the Nauvoo Legion? I did, under your direction.
    For what purpose? To suppress these insurrectionary movements. It
    was at your instance, sir, that I issued a proclamation calling
    upon the Nauvoo Legion to be in readiness, at a moment's warning,
    to guard against the incursions of mobs, and gave an order to
    Jonathan Dunham acting major-general, to that effect. Am I then
    to be charged for the acts of others; and because lawlessness and
    mobocracy abound, am I when carrying out your instructions, to be
    charged with not abiding the {581} law? Why is it that I must be
    held accountable for other men's acts? If there is trouble in the
    country, neither I nor my people made it, and all that we have ever
    done, after much endurance on our part, is to maintain and uphold
    the Constitution and institutions of our country, and to protect an
    injured, innocent, and persecuted people against misrule and mob
    violence.

    Concerning the destruction of the press to which you refer, men may
    differ somewhat in their opinions about it; but can it be supposed
    that after all the indignities to which we have been subjected
    outside, that this people could suffer a set of worthless vagabonds
    to come into our city, and right under our own eyes and protection,
    vilify and calumniate not only ourselves, but the character of our
    wives and daughters, as was impudently and unblushingly done in
    that infamous and filthy sheet? There is not a city in the United
    States that would have suffered such an indignity for twenty-four
    hours.

    Our whole people were indignant, and loudly called upon our city
    authorities for redress of their grievances, which, if not attended
    to they themselves would have taken the matter into their own
    hands, and have summarily punished the audacious wretches, as they
    deserved.

    The principles of equal rights that have been instilled into our
    bosoms from our cradles, as American citizens, forbid us submitting
    to every foul indignity, and succumbing and pandering to wretches
    so infamous as these. But, independent of this, the course that we
    pursued we considered to be strictly legal; for, notwithstanding
    the insult we were anxious to be governed strictly by law, and
    therefore convened the City Council; and being desirous in our
    deliberations to abide law, summoned legal counsel to be present on
    the occasion.

    Upon investigating the matter, we found that our City Charter
    gave us power to remove all nuisances; and, furthermore, upon
    consulting Blackstone upon what might be considered a nuisance,
    that distinguished lawyer, who is considered authority, I believe,
    in all our courts, states, among other things, that a libelous and
    filthy press may be considered a nuisance, and abated as such.

    Here, then one of the most eminent English barristers, whose works
    are considered standard with us, declares that a libelous press
    may be considered a nuisance; and our own charter, given us by the
    legislature of this State, gives us the power to remove nuisances;
    and by ordering that press abated as a nuisance, we conceived that
    we were acting strictly in accordance with law. We made that order
    in our corporate capacity, and the City Marshal carried it out. It
    is possible {582} there may have been some better way, but I must
    confess that I could not see it.

    In relation to the writ served upon us, we were willing to abide
    the consequences of our own acts, but were unwilling, in answering
    a writ of that kind, to submit to illegal exactions sought to be
    imposed upon us under the pretense of law, when we knew they were
    in open violation of it.

    When that document was presented to me by Mr. Bettisworth, I
    offered, in the presence of more than 20 persons, to go to any
    other magistrate, either in our city of Appanoose, or any other
    place where we should be safe, but we all refused to put ourselves
    into the power of a mob.

    What right had that constable to refuse our request? He had none
    according to law; for you know, Governor Ford, that the statute
    law in Illinois is, that the parties served with the writ shall
    go before him who issued it, or some other justice of the peace.
    Why, then, should we be dragged to Carthage, where the law does
    not compel us to go? Does not this look like many others of our
    prosecutions with which you are acquainted? And had we not a right
    to expect foul play?

    This very act was a breach of law on his part--an assumption of
    power that did not belong to him, and an attempt, at least, to
    deprive us of our legal and constitutional rights and privileges.
    What could we do under the circumstances different from what we
    did do? We sued for, and obtained a writ of _habeas corpus_ from
    the Municipal Court, by which we were delivered from the hands of
    Constable Bettisworth, and brought before and acquitted by the
    Municipal Court.

    After our acquittal, in a conversation with Judge Thomas, although
    he considered the acts of the party illegal, he advised, that to
    satisfy the people, we had better go before another magistrate who
    was not in our Church.

    In accordance with his advice we went before Esq. Wells, with whom
    you are well acquainted; both parties were present, witnesses were
    called on both sides, the case was fully investigated, and we were
    again dismissed.

    And what is this pretended desire to enforce law, and these lying,
    base rumors put into circulation for, but to seek, through mob
    influence, under pretense of law, to make us submit to requisitions
    that are contrary to law, and subversive of every principle of
    justice?

    And when you, sir, required us to come out here, we came, not
    because it was legal, but because you required it of us, and we
    were desirous of showing to you and to all men that we shrunk not
    from the most rigid investigation of our acts.

    {583} We certainly did expect other treatment than to be immured
    in a jail at the instance of these men, and I think, from your
    plighted faith, we had a right to, after disbanding our own forces,
    and putting ourselves entirely in your hands; and now, after having
    fulfilled my part, sir, as a man and an American citizen, I call
    upon you, Governor Ford, and think I have a right to do so, to
    deliver us from this place, and rescue us from this outrage that is
    sought to be practiced upon us by a set of infamous scoundrels.

    _Gov. Ford--_But you have placed men under arrest, detained men as
    prisoners, and given passes to others, some of which I have seen.

    _John P. Greene, City Marshal--_Perhaps I can explain. Since these
    difficulties have commenced, you are aware that we have been placed
    under very peculiar circumstance, our city has been placed under a
    very rigid police guard; in addition to this, frequent guards have
    been placed outside the city to prevent any sudden surprise, and
    those guards have questioned suspected or suspicious persons as to
    their business.

    To strangers, in some instances, passes have been given, to prevent
    difficulty in passing those guards. It is some of those passes that
    you have seen. No person, sir, has been imprisoned without a legal
    cause in our city.

    _Gov.--_Why did you not give a more speedy answer to the _posse_
    that I sent out?

    _Gen. Smith.--_We had matters of importance to consult upon. Your
    letter showed anything but an amicable spirit. We have suffered
    immensely in Missouri from mobs, in loss of property, imprisonment,
    and otherwise.

    It took some time for us to weigh duly these matters. We could not
    decide upon the matters of such importance immediately, and your
    _posse_ were too hasty in returning. We were consulting for a large
    people, and vast interests were at stake.

    We had been outrageously imposed upon, and knew not how far we
    could trust anyone; besides, a question necessarily arose, how
    shall we come? Your request was that we should come unarmed. It
    became a matter of serious importance to decide how far promises
    could be trusted, and how far we were safe from mob violence.

    _Geddes--_It certainly did look from all I have heard, from the
    general spirit of violence and mobocracy that here prevails, that
    it was not safe for you to come unprotected.

    _Gov.--_I think that sufficient time was not allowed by the _posse_
    for you to consult and get ready. They were too hasty; but I
    suppose they found themselves bound by their orders. I think, too,
    there is a {584} great deal of truth in what you say, and your
    reasoning is plausible; yet, I must beg leave to differ from you
    in relation to the acts of the City Council. That council in my
    opinion, had no right to act in a legislative capacity, and in that
    of the judiciary.

    They should have passed a law in relation to the matter, and then
    the Municipal Court, upon complaint, could have removed it; but for
    the City Council to take upon themselves the law-making and the
    execution of the laws, in my opinion, was wrong; besides, these men
    ought to have had a hearing before their property was destroyed; to
    destroy it without was an infringement of their rights; besides, it
    is so contrary to the feelings of the American people to interfere
    with the press.

    And furthermore, I cannot but think that it would have been more
    judicious for you to have gone with Mr. Bettisworth to Carthage,
    notwithstanding the law did not require it. Concerning your being
    in jail, I am sorry for that, I wish it had been otherwise. I hope
    you will soon be released, but I cannot interfere.

    _Joseph Smith--_Governor Ford, allow me, sir, to bring one thing
    to your mind, that you seem to have overlooked. You state that you
    think it would have been better for us to have submitted to the
    requisition of Constable Bettisworth, and to have gone to Carthage.

    Do you not know, sir, that that writ was served at the instance of
    an anti-Mormon mob, who had passed resolutions and published them
    to the effect that they would exterminate the Mormon leaders; and
    are you not informed that Captain Anderson was not only threatened
    when coming to Nauvoo, but had a gun fired at his boat by this
    said mob at Warsaw, when coming up to Nauvoo, and that this very
    thing was made use of as a means to get us into their hands, and we
    could not, without taking an armed force with us, go there without,
    according to their published declarations, going into the jaws of
    death?

    To have taken a force would only have fanned the excitement,
    as they would have stated that we wanted to use intimidation,
    therefore we thought it the most judicious to avail ourselves of
    the protection of the law.

    _Gov.--_I see, I see.

    _Joseph Smith--_Furthermore, in relation to the press, you say that
    you differ with me in opinion; be it so, the thing after all is a
    legal difficulty, and the courts I should judge competent to decide
    on that matter.

    If our act was illegal, we are willing to meet it; and although
    I cannot see the distinction that you draw about the acts of the
    City Council, and what difference it could have made in point of
    fact, law, or justice, between the City Council's acting together
    or separate, or how {585} much more legal it would have been for
    the Municipal Court, who were a part of the City Council, to act
    separate, instead of with the councilors.

    Yet, if it is deemed that we did a wrong in destroying that press,
    we refuse not to pay for it. We are desirous to fulfill the law in
    every particular, and are responsible for our acts.

    You say that the parties ought to have had a hearing. Had it been
    a civil suit, this of course would have been proper; but there was
    a flagrant violation of every principle of right, a nuisance, and
    it was abated on the same principle that any nuisance, stench, or
    putrified carcass would have been removed.

    Our first step, therefore, was to stop the foul, noisome, filthy
    sheet, and then the next, in our opinion, would have been to have
    prosecuted the men for a breech of public decency.

    And furthermore, again, let me say, Governor Ford, I shall look
    to you for our protection. I believe you are talking of going to
    Nauvoo; if you go, sir, I wish to go along. I refuse not to answer
    any law, but I do not consider myself safe here.

    _Gov._ I am in hopes that you will be acquitted; but if I go, I
    will certainly take you along. I do not, however, apprehend danger.
    I think you are perfectly safe, either here or anywhere else. I
    cannot, however, interfere with the law. I am placed in peculiar
    circumstances and seem to be blamed by all parties.

    _Joseph Smith--_Governor Ford, I ask nothing but what is legal,
    I have a right to expect protection at least from you; for,
    independent of law, you have pledged your faith, and that of the
    State, for my protection, and I wish to go to Nauvoo.

    _Gov.--_And you shall have protection, General Smith. I did not
    make this promise without consulting my officers, who all pledged
    their honor to its fulfillment. I do not know that I shall go
    tomorrow to Nauvoo, but if I do, I will take you along. [2]

{586} _10:15 a.m.--_The Governor left after saying that the prisoners
were under his protection, and again pledging himself that they should
be protected from violence, and telling them that if the troops marched
the next morning to Nauvoo, as he then expected, they should probably
be taken along, in order to insure their personal safety, with how much
sincerity may be seen by the following affidavits:--

    _Affidavit--Alfred Randall--Threats against the Prophet's life in
    Carthage_.

    TERRITORY OF UTAH,

    GREAT SALT LAKE CITY. ss

    Personally appeared before me, Thomas Bullock, Recorder of Great
    Salt Lake County, Alfred Randall, who deposes and says, that about
    ten o'clock on the morning of the (26th) twenty sixth day of June,
    one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, he was in Carthage,
    Hancock county, Illinois, and as the troops, under Governor Thomas
    Ford, were in squads around the square, he went up to several
    of them, and heard one of the soldiers say: "When I left home I
    calculated a see old Joe dead before I returned," when several
    others said, "So did I," "So did I," and "I'll be damned if I
    don't," was the general reply.

    One fellow then spoke up and said "I shouldn't wonder if there is
    some damned Mormon hearing all we have to say." Another who stood
    next to Randall, replied, "If I knew there was, I would run him
    through with my bayonet."

    In a few minutes Randall went to another crowd of soldiers, and
    heard one say, "I guess this will be the last of old Joe." From
    there Randall went to Hamilton's Hotel, where Governor Thomas Ford
    was standing by the fence side, and heard another soldier tell
    Governor Thomas Ford, "The soldiers are determined to see Joe Smith
    dead before they leave here." Ford replied, "If you know of any
    such thing keep it to yourself."

    In a short time Randall started for his own home, stayed all night,
    and arrived in Nauvoo on the twenty-seventh of June, when Governor
    {587} Ford was making his notorious speech to the citizens. And
    further this deponent saith not.

    THOMAS BULLOCK,

    Recorder, Great Salt Lake County.

    _Affidavit--Jonathan C. Wright--Conspiracy against the Prophet's
    Life at Carthage_.

    On the 26th day of June, A. D. 1844, near the mansion in the city
    of Nauvoo, I fell in company with Col. Enoch C. March and Geo. T.
    M. Davis, Esq.. from Alton, Illinois, editor of the_ Telegraph_,
    who had just arrived from Carthage, where they said they had been
    for some days, in company with Governor Ford and others, in council
    upon the subject of the arrest and trial of Joseph and Hyrum Smith,
    who were then prisoners in the county jail in Carthage.

    After considerable conversation between myself and them on the
    subject of the Mormon religion, and the reasons why I had embraced
    that faith, and renounced my former religious discipline--viz, that
    of the Methodists, Mr. March asked me what I thought of Joe Smith,
    and if I had any hopes of his return to Nauvoo in safety.

    I answered that I knew Joseph Smith was a true Prophet of the
    living God, as good and virtuous a man as ever lived upon the
    earth; that the Book or Mormon was true as holy writ, and was
    brought forth precisely in the way and manner it purported to be,
    by the gift and power of the Lord Almighty, and from no other
    source; and that the revelations he had received and published were
    eternal truth, and heaven and earth would pass away before one
    jot or tittle of the same should fail, and all that he pretended
    and testified to concerning the ministration of holy angels from
    the heavens to him, the Urim and Thummim, the voice of God, his
    correspondence with the heavens, was the truth and nothing but the
    truth; and that in relation to his return I had no doubt but that
    he would be honorably discharged upon his trial by the court, and
    would be preserved in safety from the power of his enemies; that he
    was in the hands of his God, whom he loved and faithfully served;
    and He, who held the destinies of nations in His own hands, would
    deliver him from his enemies, as He had done hundreds of times
    before.

    Col. March replied, "Mr. Wright, you are mistaken, and I know it;
    you do not know what I know; I tell you they will kill Joe Smith
    before he leaves Carthage, and I know it, and you never will see
    him alive {588} again." Said I, "Enoch, I do not believe it, he is
    in the hands of God, and God will deliver him." Says he, "I know
    better; when you hear of him again, you will hear he is dead, and I
    know it. The people at Carthage wanted permission from the Governor
    to kill you all and burn up your city, and Ford (the Governor)
    asked me if I thought it was best to suffer it. I replied, "No,
    no, for God's sake, Ford, don't suffer it, that will never do, no
    never. Just see for a moment, Ford, what that would do; it would
    be the means of murdering thousands of innocent men, women and
    children, and destroying thousands of dollars' worth of property,
    and that would never do, it would not be sanctioned, it would
    disgrace the nation. You have now got the principle men here under
    your own control, they are all you want, what more do you want?
    When they are out of the way the thing is settled, and the people
    will be satisfied, and that is the easiest way you can dispose of
    it; and Governor Ford concluded upon the whole that was the best
    policy, and I know it will be done."

    the hour of 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the 27th day of June,
    one thousand eight hundred forty-four, a short time only before
    Governor Ford addressed the citizens of Nauvoo, he (Ford) and his
    suit occupied an upper room in the mansion of Joseph Smith, in the
    city of Nauvoo, when he, the said Rockwell, had of necessity to
    enter said upper room for his hat, and as he entered the door, all
    were sitting silent except one man, who was standing behind a chair
    making a speech, and while in the act of dropping his right hand
    from an uplifted position, said. "The {589} deed is done before
    this time," which were the only words I heard while in the room,
    for on seeing me they all hushed in silence. At that time I could
    not comprehend the meaning of the words, but in a few hours after
    I understood them as referring to the murder of Joseph and Hyrum
    Smith in Carthage jail.

    _Affidavit:--Wm. G. Sterrett--Conduct of Gov. Ford and Posse While
    in Nauvoo_.

    STATE OF DESERET, GREAT SALT LAKE COUNTY.

    Personally appeared before me, Thomas Bullock, Recorder in and for
    Great Salt Lake County, this third day of October, one thousand
    eight hundred and fifty, William G. Sterrett, who being first duly
    sworn, deposeth and saith that on the twenty-seventh day of June,
    one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, in the city of Nauvoo,
    county of Hancock, and State of Illinois, I heard Thomas Ford,
    Governor of Illinois, address an assembly of several thousand
    citizens, gathered around the frame of a building situated at the
    corner of Water and Main streets. He reproached the people in
    severe terms for the course they had taken in resisting the _posse
    comitatus,_ and among other things, "The retribution thereof will
    be terrible, and you must make up your minds for it. I hope you
    will not make any more trouble, but be a law-abiding people, for if
    I have to come again it will be worse for you."

    And your deponent further saith, that about half-past five in the
    afternoon the said Governor Thomas Ford and his guard visited the
    Temple and the workshops on the Temple block,

    Mr. Alpheus Cutler, one of the building committee of the Temple,
    sent me to watch them in and about the Temple. I was close to the
    Governor when one of his men called him to look at one of the oxen
    of the font in the basement of the Temple, that had part of one
    horn broken off. The Governor stepped up to it, and laying his hand
    on it remarked, "This is the cow with the crumply horn, that we
    read of." One of the staff continued, "That tossed the maiden all
    forlorn," and they all had a laugh about it.

    Several of the horns were broken off the oxen by the Governor's
    attendants. A man who stood behind me said, "I'll be damned but I
    should like to take one of those horns home with me, to show as a
    curiosity, but it is a pity to break them off."

    {590} After they had passed round the font, one of them remarked,
    "This temple is a curious piece of workmanship, and it was a damned
    shame that they did not let Joe Smith finish it, so that we could
    have seen what sort of a finish he would have put on it, for it
    is altogether a different style of architecture from any building
    I have ever seen or read about." Another said, "But he is dead by
    this time, and he will never see this temple again."

    I replied, "They cannot kill him until he has finished his work."
    The Governor thereupon gave a very significant grin, when one of
    his suit who stood next to me said, "Whether he has finished his
    work or not by God he will not see this place again, for he's
    finished before this time."

    Another of his suit pulled out his watch and said, "Governor, it's
    time we were off, we have been here too long already. Whether
    you go or not, I'm going to leave, and that damned quick." The
    Governor said, "Yes, it's time for us to be going." They then all
    left the stone shop, mounted their horses, which were hitched
    near the temple, and went out of the city towards Carthage by way
    of Mulholland Street, taking with them one of the horns that the
    company had knocked off. Further this deponent saith not.

While Joseph was writing at the jailor's desk, William Wall stepped up,
wanting to deliver a verbal message to him from his uncle John Smith.
He turned round to speak to Wall, but the guard refused to allow them
any communication.

At noon Joseph wrote to Judge Thomas as follows:

    Counsel_.

    CARTHAGE JAIL, June 26, 1844.

    _His Hon. Judge Thomas_.

    DEAR SIR,--You will perceive by my date that I am in prison. Myself
    and brother Hyrum were arrested yesterday on charge of treason
    without bringing us before the magistrate; last evening we were
    committed {591} on a mittimus from Justice Robert F. Smith, stating
    that we had been before the magistrate, which is _utterly false;_
    but from the appearance of the case at present, we can have no
    reasonable prospect of anything but partial decisions of law, and
    all the prospect we have of justice being done is to get our case
    on _habeas corpus_ before an impartial judge; the excitement and
    prejudice is such in this place, testimony is of little avail.

    Therefore, sir, I earnestly request your honor to repair to
    Nauvoo without delay, and make yourself at home at my house until
    the papers can be in readiness for you to bring us on _habeas
    corpus._ Our witnesses are all at Nauvoo, and there you can easily
    investigate the whole matter, and I will be responsible to you for
    all the trouble and expense.

Footnotes:

1. This report of the Prophet's interview with Governor Ford, it is
only proper to say, was not written until a number of years after the
interview took place. (See ms. Statement, Feb. 22, 1847, on Atlantic
Ocean; also in _Taylor's Journal_, kept at Nauvoo, c. f. with "The
Martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, opening paragraphs, published in
Tyler's "Mormon Battalion.") The extract above quoted is taken from
"Taylor's Martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith," written at the request
of George A. Smith and Wilford Woodruff "Church Historian," hence no
earlier than 1854-1856, since Geo. A. Smith did not become Historian
until the year first given, and Wilford Woodruff, assistant Historian
in the second. The interview therefore, though given in dialogue form,
can only be Elder Taylor's recollection of it, and could not be a
_verbatum_ report.

2. Thomas Gregg, author of the History of Hancock County, page 372,
gives the following statement of Col. Thomas Geddes mentioned in the
above interview as the companion of Governor Ford. If true, and it is
quite in keeping with all the circumstances and with both the character
and subsequent actions of the Governor, then it is a very important
statement as showing the double dealing of which Governor Ford was
always suspected in relation to his course with reference to the
difficulties between the citizens of Nauvoo and their enemies. And now
Col. Geddes as reported by Gregg:

"While the Smiths were in jail, I went to the jail in company with
Governor Ford, and there we conversed with them for some time,
the burden of Smith's talk being that they were only acting in
self-defense, and only wanted to be let alone. After leaving the jail,
and while returning from it, the Governor and I had still further
conversation about the subject matter. After some time the Governor
exclaimed, "O, it's all nonsense; you will have to drive these Mormons
out yet!" I then said: "If we undertake that, Governor, when the proper
time comes, will you interfere?" "No, I will not," said he; then, after
a pause, adding, "until you are through!"

CHAPTER XXXI.

THE PROPHET IN CARTHAGE PRISON--THE UNION OF JUDICIAL, EXECUTIVE, AND
MILITARY AUTHORITY IN DEALING WITH THE PRISONERS--THE LAST NIGHT IN
PRISON.

_Wednesday, June 26, 1844.--(Noon)--_Willard Richards made copies of
the orders of Joseph Smith as Mayor to Marshal John P. Greene, and as
Lieut.-General to Major-General Jonathan Dunham.

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Anxiety for His own Safety.]

Joseph remarked, "I have had a good deal of anxiety about my safety
since I left Nauvoo, which I never had before when I was under arrest.
I could not help those feelings, and they have depressed me." Most of
the forenoon was spent by Dan Jones and Col. Stephen Markham in hewing
with a penknife a warped door to get it on the latch, thus preparing to
fortify the place against any attack.

The Prophet, Patriarch, and their friends took turns preaching to
the guards, several of whom were relieved before their time was out,
because they admitted they were convinced of the innocence of the
prisoners. They frequently admitted they had been imposed upon, and
more than once it was heard, "Let us go home, boys, for I will not
fight any longer against these men."

[Sidenote: Hyrum as Comforter.]

During the day Hyrum encouraged Joseph to think that the Lord, for his
Church's sake, would release him from prison. Joseph replied, "Could my
brother, Hyrum but be liberated, it would not matter so much about me.
Poor Rigdon, I am glad he is gone to Pittsburgh out of the way; were he
to preside he {593} would lead the Church to destruction in less than
five years."

Dr. Richards was busily engaged writing as dictated by the Prophet,
and Elder Taylor amused him by singing. Joseph related his dream about
William and Wilson Law, also his dream about trying to save a steamboat
in a storm.

[Sidenote: Status of Prisoners Under the Law.]

One of the counsel for the prosecution expressed a wish to Esq. Reid,
that the prisoners should be brought out of jail for examination on the
charge of treason. He was answered that the prisoners had already been
committed "until discharged by due course of law," and therefore the
justice and constable had no further control of the prisoners, and that
if the prosecutors wished the prisoners brought out of jail, they might
bring them out on a writ of_ habeas corpus,_ or some other "due course
of law," when we would appear and defend.

_12:30, noon--_Dr. Bernhisel arrived at the jail.

Mr. Reid came with the following letter from General Deming.

    _Letter--Gen. Miner R. Deming to Joseph Smith--Protection and
    Admission to Presence of the Prophet_.

    _Messrs. Smith,--_I was requested by the governor to order you
    such protection as circumstances might require. The guard have
    been acting upon the supposition that your protection excluded all
    persons but those admitted by a pass. I have caused the officer of
    the guard to be correctly instructed of his duties, so that you
    need suffer no further inconvenience.

    M. R. DEMING, Brig.-Gen'l.

    Headquarters,

    Carthage, June 26, 1844.

[Sidenote: Effect of a False Commitment.]

Counselor Reid said that he had got the magistrate on a pin hook, for
the magistrate had committed them without examination, and had no
further jurisdiction in the case, {594} and he would not agree to a
trial unless (Captain) Justice Smith would consent to go to Nauvoo for
examination, where witnesses could be had.

Reid said that a week ago, Harmon T. Wilson and another, had concocted
a scheme for a writ to take Joseph, and when he was apprehended, to
take him to Missouri; and Harmon T. Wilson returned from Missouri the
night before the burning of the press.

_1 p.m.--_Willard Richards wrote to his wife, and sent the letter by
Cyrus C. Canfield.

[Sidenote: Threats in Governor's Presence.]

It was common conversation on the camp ground and in the dining-room of
the hotel, in the presence of Governor Ford, "The law is too short for
these men, but they must not be suffered to go at large;" and, "if the
law will not reach them, powder and ball must."

[Sidenote: Loyalty of Mr. Stigall to His Prisoners.]

_Half past 2--_Constable Bettisworth came with Alexander Simpson, and
wanted to come in, with an order to the jailor demanding the prisoners;
but as Mr. Stigall, the jailor, could find no law authorizing a justice
of the peace to demand prisoners committed to his charge, he refused to
give them up until discharged from his custody by due course of the law.

[Sidenote: Conference of Gov. Ford and Justice Smith.]

Justice Robert F. Smith then inquired what he must do. Governor Ford
replied, "We have plenty of troops; there are the Carthage Greys under
your command bring them out." Joseph sent Lorenzo D. Wasson to inform
the Governor of what had just taken place, and also to inform his
counsel, Messrs. Reid and Woods.

_Twenty minutes to 3--_Dr. Bernhisel returned from the Governor, and
said apparently the Governor was doing all he could.

_3 p.m.--_Wrote to Messrs. Woods and Reid as follows which was carried
by Elder John Taylor.

{595}

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to Messrs. Woods and Reid--Anent Excitement
    in Carthage_.

    CARTHAGE JAIL, June 26, 3 p.m.

    _Messrs. Woods and Reid_.

    SIRs,--Constable Bettisworth called a little while since, and
    wanted to come in, the guard would not [allow it]. We have since
    learned that he wanted to take us before the magistrate, and we
    have since learned that there is some excitement because we did not
    go, and we wish to see you without delay.

    We are informed that Dr. Foster has said that they can do nothing
    with us, only by powder and ball, as we have done nothing against
    the law.

    Yours,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    Per W. RICHARDS.

[Sidenote: Joseph and Hyrum Smith Forced from Prison.]

_Twenty minutes to 4--_Upon the refusal of the jailor to give up the
prisoners, the constable with the company of Carthage Greys, under the
command of Frank Worrell, marched to the jail, and by intimidation
and threats, compelled the jailor, against his will and conviction of
duty, to deliver Joseph and Hyrum to the Constable, who forthwith, and
contrary to their wishes, compulsorily took them.

Joseph, seeing the mob gathering and assuming a threatening aspect,
concluded it best to go with them then, and putting on his hat, walked
boldly into the midst of a hollow square of the Carthage Greys; yet
evidently expecting to be massacred in the streets before arriving at
the Court House, politely locked arms with the worst mobocrat he could
see, and Hyrum locked arms with Joseph, followed by Dr. Richards,
and escorted by a guard. Elders Taylor, Jones, Markham, and Fullmer
followed, outside the hollow square, and accompanied them to the court
room.

[Sidenote: Prisoners Before the Court.]

_4 o'clock.--_Case called by Robert F. Smith, Captain of {596} the
Carthage Greys. The counsel for the prisoners then appeared, and called
for subpoenas for witnesses on the part of the prisoners, and expressed
their wish to go into the examination as soon as the witnesses could be
brought from Nauvoo to Carthage. This was objected to most vehemently
by the opposite counsel.

_4:25.--_Took copy of order to bring prisoners from jail for trial, as
follows:--

    _Copy of Order to Bring Prisoners into Court_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY. ss

    To David Bettisworth, Constable of said county.

    You are hereby commanded to bring the bodies of Joseph Smith and
    Hyrum Smith from the jail of said county, forthwith before me at my
    office, for an examination on the charge of treason, they having
    been committed for safe keeping until trial could be had on such
    examination, and the state now being ready for such examination.

    Given under my hand and seal this 26th day of June, 1844.

    (Signed) R. F. SMITH, J. P. [L. S.]

_4:30--_Made a copy of the list of witnesses.

_4:35--_C. L. Higbee, O. C. Skinner, Thos. Sharp, Sylvester Emmons and
Thos. Morrison, appeared as counsel for the State.

The writ was returned, endorsed,

"Served on June 25th," which was false.

Mr. Wood said, they were committed to jail without any examination
whatever.

Mr. Reid urged a continuance of the case till the witnesses could be
obtained from Nauvoo for the defense.

_4:45 p.m.--_Mr. Skinner suggested that the court adjourn until 12
o'clock tomorrow.

Mr. Wood proposed that the court adjourn until witnesses could be got
together, or until tomorrow at any time, and again adjourn if they are
not ready, without bringing the prisoners into court.

Mr. Reid hoped no compulsory measures would be made {597} use of by the
prosecution in this enlightened country.

Mr. Skinner: "If witnesses cannot be had after due diligence by the
defense, a continuance will be granted."

Court said this writ was served yesterday, (which was not the case,
unless it could be served without the prisoners or their counsel
knowing it).

[Sidenote: Examination Postponed.]

On motion of counsel for the prisoners, examination was postponed
till tomorrow at 12 o'clock noon, and subpoenas were granted to get
witnesses from Nauvoo, twenty miles distance, whereupon the prisoners
were remanded to prison with the following mittimus:--

    _Second Mittimus Remanding Smith Brothers to Prison_.

    STATE OF ILLINOIS,

    HANCOCK COUNTY. ss

    To the keeper of the jail of Hancock County, Illinois, greeting:

    Whereas Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith have been arrested and brought
    before me, Robert F. Smith, a justice of the peace in and for said
    county, for examination on the charge of treason against the State
    of Illinois, and have applied for a continuance, which is granted
    until the 27th June, 1844, at 12 o'clock, m.

    These are therefore to command you to receive the said Joseph Smith
    and Hyrum Smith into your custody in the jail of the county, there
    to remain until they are brought before me for said examination
    according to law.

    Given under my hand and seal this 26th day of June, 1844.

    R. F. SMITH, J. P. [L. S.]

_5:30.--_Returned to jail, and Joseph and Hyrum were thrust into close
confinement.

[Sidenote: Brave Patriarch John Smith.]

Patriarch John Smith came from Macedonia to jail to see his nephews
Joseph and Hyrum. The road was thronged with mobbers. Three of them
snapped their guns at him, and he was threatened by many others who
recognized him. The guard at the jail refused him admittance.

Joseph saw him through the prison window, and said to {598} the guard,
"Let the old gentleman come in, he is my uncle." The guard replied they
did not care who the hell he was uncle to, he should not go in.

[Sidenote: Pathetic Interview Between the Prophet and "Uncle John."]

Joseph replied, "You will not hinder so old and infirm a man as he
is from coming in," and then said, "Come in uncle;" on which, after
searching him closely the guard let him pass into the jail, where he
remained about an hour. He asked Joseph if he thought he should again
get out of the hands of his enemies, when he replied, "My brother
Hyrum thinks I shall. I wish you would tell the brethren in Macedonia
that they can see by this, that it has not been safe for me to visit
them; and tell Almon W. Babbitt I want him to come and assist me as an
attorney at my expected trial tomorrow before Captain R. F. Smith."

Father Smith then left the jail to convey this message to A. W.
Babbitt, who was at Macedonia.

_6 p.m.--_Copied witnesses' names and mittimus.

Dr. Bernhisel brought the following:--

    _The Governor's Suggestions to the Jailor_.

    I would advise the jailor to keep the Messrs. Smith in the room in
    which I found them this morning, unless a closer confinement should
    be clearly necessary to prevent an escape.

    THOMAS FORD,

    Governor and Commander in-Chief.

    June 26th, 1844.

_6:15 p.m.--_Received the following letter from William Clayton:--

    _Letter:--William Clayton to Joseph Smith--Conditions in Nauvoo_.

    NAUVOO, June 26, 1844.

    DEAR PRESIDENT,--

    I write this line to inform you that Mr. Marsh, who lives down the
    river, and of whom you have had corn, pork, etc., has sent word
    if you {599} want any bail he is ready for one to any amount; and
    further, that he has got some corn left which he wants you to have,
    lest the mob get it. (We will endeavor to obtain it.)

    They have already taken two loads, but he has charged them a dollar
    a bushel for it.

    The _Amaranth_ has just landed at the foot of Main Street, and
    unloaded 200 bbls. flour,--95 for Mr. Kimball, and the balance for
    Bryant.

    Captain Singleton, who came at the head of the police this morning,
    is sending a request to the Governor to call them home. He says he
    finds no difficulties to settle here, but there is plenty to settle
    at home. He furthermore says that while the police were at Carthage
    they were treated as soldiers, but since they came to Nauvoo they
    have been treated as gentlemen.

    The company all got home safe and well last night.

    A messenger is about to start forthwith to Judge Thomas.

    All is peace in Nauvoo. Many threats keep coming that the mob are
    determined to attack the city in your absence, but we have no fears.

    With fervency and true friendship, I remain yours eternally,

    WILLIAM CLAYTON.

This letter was sent from Nauvoo by Joel S. Miles. Joseph instructed
Cahoon to return to Nauvoo with all haste, and fetch a number of
documents for the promised trial.

_Twenty-five minutes to 7.--_Sent a message to Counselor Woods to get
subpoenas for Samuel James, Edward Hunter, and Philip B. Lewis, with
instructions to bring with them the papers that they carried to the
Governor at Springfield, and which the Governor had not seen, as he had
started for Carthage before they arrived at Springfield.

_Fifteen minutes to 8.--_Supper.

[Sidenote: Militia Council meeting at Carthage.]

_8 p.m.--_Counselors Woods and Reid called with Elder John P. Greene,
and said that the Governor and military officers had held a council
which had been called by the Governor, and they decided that the
Governor, and all the troops should march to Nauvoo at eight o'clock
to-morrow, except one company of about 50 men, in order to gratify
the troops, and return next day, the company {600} of fifty men to
be selected by the Governor from those of the troops whose fidelity
he could most rely on, to guard the prisoners, who should be left in
Carthage jail; and that their trial be deferred until Saturday, the
29th.

After the consultation, the justice, (Robert F. Smith), who was one of
the officers in command, altered the return of the subpoenas until the
29th. This was done without consulting either the prisoners or their
counsel.

_About 8:15, p.m.--_Patriarch John Smith met Lawyer Babbitt, and
delivered the message, when Babbitt replied "You are too late, I am
already engaged on the other side."

_9 p.m.--_Messrs. Woods, Reid, and Greene returned to Hamilton's Hotel.

_9:15.--_Elder John Taylor prayed. Willard Richards, John Taylor, John
S. Fullmer, Stephen Markham, and Dan Jones stayed with Joseph and Hyrum
in the front room.

[Sidenote: The Last Night in Carthage Prison.]

During the evening the Patriarch Hyrum Smith read and commented upon
extracts from the Book of Mormon, on the imprisonments and deliverance
of the servants of God for the Gospel's sake. Joseph bore a powerful
testimony to the guards of the divine authenticity of the Book of
Mormon, restoration of the Gospel, the administration of angels, and
that the kingdom of God was again established upon the earth, for the
sake of which he was then incarcerated in that prison, and not because
he had violated any law of God or man.

[Sidenote: Conversation with John S. Fullmer.]

They retired to rest late. Joseph and Hyrum occupied the only bedstead
in the room, while their friends lay side by side on the mattresses on
the floor. Dr. Richards sat up writing until his last candle left him
in the dark. The report of a gun fired close by caused Joseph to arise,
leave the bed, and lay himself on the floor, having Dan Jones on his
left, and John S. Fullmer on his right. {601} Joseph laid out his right
arm, and said to John S. Fullmer, "Lay your head on my arm for a pillow
Brother John;" and when all were quiet they conversed in a low tone
about the prospects of their deliverance. Joseph gave expression to
several presentiments that he had to die, and said "I would like to see
my family again," and "I would to God that I could preach to the Saints
in Nauvoo once more." Fullmer tried to rally his spirits, saying he
thought he would often have that privilege, when Joseph thanked him for
the remarks and good feelings expressed to him.

[Sidenote: Prophecy on the Head of Dan Jones.]

Soon after Dr. Richards retired to the bed which Joseph had left, and
when all were apparently fast asleep, Joseph whispered to Dan Jones,
"are you afraid to die?" Dan said, "Has that time come, think you?
Engaged in such a cause I do not think that death would have many
terrors." Joseph replied, "You will yet see Wales, and fulfill the
mission appointed you before you die."

{602}



CHAPTER XXXII.

THE DAY OF MARTYRDOM--THREATS--REPEATED WARNINGS OF THE PRISONERS'
DANGER GIVEN TO GOVERNOR FORD--THE CARTHAGE GREYS AS GUARDS.

_Thursday, 27, 5 a.m.--_John P. Greene and William W. Phelps called
at the jail, on their way to Nauvoo.

[Sidenote: Threats of Frank Worrell.]

_5:30 a.m.--_Arose. Joseph requested Dan Jones to descend and inquire
of the guard the cause of the disturbance in the night. Frank Worrell,
the officer of the guard, who was one of the Carthage Greys, in a very
bitter spirit said, "We have had too much trouble to bring Old Joe here
to let him ever escape alive, and unless you want to die with him you
had better leave before sundown; and you are not a damned bit better
than him for taking his part, and you'll see that I can prophesy better
than Old Joe, for neither he nor his brother, nor anyone who will
remain with them will see the sun set today."

[Sidenote: Governor Ford Warned of Worrell's Threat.]

Joseph directed Jones to go to Governor Ford and inform him what he
had been told by the officer of the guard. While Jones was going to
Governor Ford's quarters, he saw an assemblage of men, and heard one of
them, who was apparently a leader, making a speech, saying that, "Our
troops will be discharged this morning in obedience to orders, and for
a sham we will leave the town; but when the Governor and the McDonough
troops have left {603} for Nauvoo this afternoon, we will return and
kill those men, if we have to tear the jail down." This sentiment was
applauded by three cheers from the crowd.

Captain Jones went to the Governor, told him what had occurred in the
night, what the officer of the guard had said, and what he had heard
while coming to see him, and earnestly solicited him to avert the
danger.

His Excellency replied, "You are unnecessarily alarmed for the safety
of your friends, sir, the people are not that cruel."

[Sidenote: Jones' Warning to Gov. Ford.]

Irritated by such a remark, Jones urged the necessity of placing better
men to guard them than professed assassins, and said, "The Messrs.
Smith are American citizens, and have surrendered themselves to your
Excellency upon your pledging your honor for their safety; they are
also Master Masons, and as such I demand of you protection of their
lives."

Governor Ford's face turned pale, and Jones remarked, "If you do not do
this, I have but one more desire, and that is if you leave their lives
in the hands of those men to be sacrificed--"

"What is that, sir?" he asked in a hurried tone.

"It is," said Jones, "that the Almighty will preserve my life to a
proper time and place, that I may testify that you have been timely
warned of their danger."

Jones then returned to the prison, but the guard would not let him
enter. He again returned to the hotel, and found Governor Ford standing
in front of the McDonough troops, who were in line ready to escort him
to Nauvoo.

[Sidenote: Boasts of the Mob.]

The disbanded mob retired to the rear, shouting loudly that they were
only going a short distance out of town, when they would return and
kill old Joe and Hyrum as soon as the Governor was far enough out of
town.

Jones called the attention of the Governor to the threats {604}
then made, but the Governor took no notice of them, although it was
impossible for him to avoid hearing them.

Jones then requested the Governor to give him passports for himself and
friends to pass in and out of the prison, according to his promise made
to the prisoners. He refused to give them, but he told General Deming
to give one to Dr. Willard Richards, Joseph Smith's private secretary.

[Sidenote: Chauncy L. Higbee's Declared Intention to Kill the Prophet.]

While obtaining this, Jones' life was threatened, and Chauncey L.
Higbee said to him in the street, "We are determined to kill Joe and
Hyrum, and you had better go away to save yourself."

At 7 a.m., Joseph, Hyrum, Dr. Richards, Stephen Markham and John S.
Fullmer ate breakfast together. Mr. Crane ate with them, and wanted to
know if the report was true that Joseph fainted three times on Tuesday,
while being exhibited to the troops. He was told it was a false report.

_8 a.m.--_Cyrus H. Wheelock, at Joseph's request, applied to the
Governor, and obtained the following passes:

    _Cyrus H. Wheelock's Passes_.

    Suffer Mr. C. H. Wheelock to pass in to visit General Joseph Smith
    and friends in Carthage jail unmolested.

    THOMAS FORD,

    Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

    June, 27th, 1844.

    Protect Mr. C. H. Wheelock in passing to and from Carthage and
    Nauvoo.

    THOMAS FORD,

    Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

    June 27th, 1844.

While receiving these passes he related to the Governor the numerous
threats he had heard.

John S. Fullmer went to the Governor to get a pass.

_8:20 a.m.--_Joseph wrote to Emma as follows:

    {605} _Letter: Joseph Smith to Emma Smith--Prophet's Instruction as
    to Reception of the Governor_.

    CARTHAGE JAIL, June 27th, 1844.

    20 minutes past eight a.m.

    DEAR EMMA.--The Governor continues his courtesies, and permits us
    to see our friends. We hear this morning that the Governor will
    not go down with his troops today to Nauvoo, as we anticipated
    last evening; but if he does come down with his troops you will be
    protected; and I want you to tell Brother Dunham to instruct the
    people to stay at home and attend to their own business, and let
    there be no groups or gathering together, unless by permission of
    the Governor, they are called together to receive communications
    from the Governor, which would please our people, but let the
    Governor direct.

    Brother Dunham of course will obey the orders of the government
    officers, and render them the assistance they require. There is no
    danger of any extermination order. Should there be a mutiny among
    the troops (which we do not anticipate, excitement is abating) a
    part will remain loyal and stand for the defense of the state and
    our rights.

    There is one principle which is eternal; it is the duty of all men
    to protect their lives and the lives of the household, whenever
    necessity requires, and no power has a right to forbid it, should
    the last extreme arrive, but I anticipate no such extreme, but
    caution is the parent of safety.

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    P. S.--Dear Emma, I am very much resigned to my lot, knowing I am
    justified, and have done the best that could be done. Give my love
    to the children and all my friends, Mr. Brewer, and all who inquire
    after me; and as for treason, I know that I have not committed any,
    and they cannot prove anything of the kind, so you need not have
    any fears that anything can happen to us on that account. May God
    bless you all. Amen.

_8:30.--_John S. Fullmer returned to jail.

_9:40 a.m.--_Mr. Woods and Mr. Reid called. They said another
consultation of the officers had taken place, and the former orders
of the Governor for marching to Nauvoo with the whole army were
countermanded.

[Sidenote: Dr. Southwick's Report of the Carthage Meeting.]

Dr. Southwick was in the meeting, seeing what was going on. He
afterward told Stephen Markham that the purport of the meeting was to
take into consideration the best way to stop Joseph Smith's career,
as his views on {606} government were widely circulated and took like
wildfire. They said if he did not get into the Presidential chair
this election, he would be sure to the next time; and if Illinois and
Missouri would join together and kill him, they would not be brought to
justice for it. There were delegates in said meeting from every state
in the Union except three. Governor Ford and Captain Smith were also in
the meeting.

[Sidenote: Appointment of the Carthage Greys to Guard the Prisoners.]

Captain Dunn and his company were ordered to accompany the Governor
to Nauvoo. The Carthage Greys, who had but two days before been under
arrest for insulting the commanding general, and whose conduct had been
more hostile to the prisoners than that of any other company, were
selected by Governor Ford to guard the prisoners at the jail; and other
troops composed of the mob whom the Governor had found at Carthage, and
had mustered into the service of the State and who had been promised
"full satisfaction" and that they should be marched to Nauvoo, were
disbanded and discharged in Carthage; yet Governor Ford suffered two or
three hundred armed men to remain encamped about eight miles off on the
Warsaw road, [1] apparently under the control of Col. Levi Williams,
a notoriously sworn enemy to Joseph, and who had on many occasions
threatened the destruction of Nauvoo and the death of Joseph. Moreover
it was the duty of {607} the Governor to dismiss the troops into the
hands of their several officers in order to be marched home and there
disbanded, and not to have disbanded them at a distance from home,
and at a time and place when they were predisposed to acts of lawless
violence, rapine and murder.

[Sidenote: Wheelock's Remonstrance to Gov. Ford.]

Cyrus H. Wheelock, states that previous to leaving Carthage he said to
the Governor, "Sir you must be aware by this time that the prisoners
have no fears in relation to any lawful demands made against them,
but you have heard sufficient to justify you in the belief that their
enemies would destroy them if they had them in their power; and now,
sir, I am about to leave for Nauvoo, and I fear for those men; they
are safe as regards the law, but they are not safe from the hands of
traitors, and midnight assassins who thirst for their blood and have
determined to spill it; and under these circumstances I leave with a
heavy heart."

Ford replied: "I was never in such a dilemma in my life; but your
friends shall be protected, and have a fair trial by the law; in this
_pledge_ I am not alone; I have obtained the _pledge_ of the whole of
the army to sustain me."

[Sidenote: Arms Given to the Prisoners.]

After receiving these assurances, Wheelock prepared to visit the
prison. The morning being a little rainy, favored his wearing an
overcoat, in the side pocket of which he was enabled to carry a six
shooter, and he passed the guard unmolested. During his visit in the
prison he slipped the revolver into Joseph's pocket. Joseph examined
it, and asked Wheelock if he had not better retain it for his own
protection.

This was a providential circumstance, as most other persons had been
very rigidly searched. Joseph then handed the single barrel pistol
which had been given him by John S. Fullmer, to his brother Hyrum, and
said, {608} "You may have use for this." Brother Hyrum observed, "I
hate to use such things or to see them used." "So do I," said Joseph,
"but we may have to, to defend ourselves;" upon this Hyrum took the
pistol.

Wheelock was intrusted with a verbal request to the commanders of the
Legion to avoid all military display, or any other movement calculated
to produce excitement during the Governor's visit. He was especially
charged to use all the influence he possessed to have the brethren and
friends of Joseph remain perfectly calm and quiet, inasmuch as they
respected the feelings and well-being of the Prophet and Patriarch.

[Sidenote: Reflections of the Prophet on Exposing Wickedness.]

Said Joseph, "Our lives have already become jeopardized by revealing
the wicked and bloodthirsty purposes of our enemies; and for the future
we must cease to do so. All we have said about them is truth, but it is
not always wise to relate all the truth. Even Jesus, the Son of God had
to refrain from doing so, and had to restrain His feelings many times
for the safety of Himself and His followers, and had to conceal the
righteous purposes of His heart in relation to many things pertaining
to His Father's kingdom. When still a boy He had all the intelligence
necessary to enable Him to rule and govern the kingdom of the Jews,
and could reason with the wisest and most profound doctors of law and
divinity, and make their theories and practice to appear like folly
compared with the wisdom He possessed; but He was a boy only, and
lacked physical strength even to defend His own person, and was subject
to cold, to hunger and to death. So it is with the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints; we have the revelation of Jesus, and the
knowledge within us is sufficient to organize a righteous government
upon the earth, and to give universal peace to all mankind, if they
would receive it, but we lack the physical strength, as did our Savior
when a child, to defend our principles, and we have of necessity to be
afflicted, persecuted and smitten, and to {609} bear it patiently until
Jacob is of age, then he will take care of himself."

Wheelock took a list of witnesses' names that were wanted for the
expected trial on Saturday. When the list was read over, a number of
names were stricken out, among whom were Alpheus Cutler and Reynolds
Cahoon, it being deemed by Brother Hyrum unnecessary for them to
attend. Brother Joseph asked why they should not come. Hyrum answered,
"They may be very good men, but they don't know enough to answer a
question properly." Brother Joseph remarked, "That is sufficient
reason."

[Sidenote: The Prisoner's Messages to Friends in Nauvoo.]

The prisoners also sent many verbal messages to their families. They
were so numerous that Dr. Richards proposed writing them all down,
fearing Wheelock might forget, but Brother Hyrum fastened his eyes
upon him, and with a look of penetration said, "Brother Wheelock will
remember all that we tell him, and he will never forget the occurrences
of this day."

Joseph related the following dream which he had last night:

[Sidenote: The Prophet's Dream of his Kirtland Farm]

"I was back in Kirtland, Ohio, and thought I would take a walk out
by myself, and view my old farm, which I found grown up with weeds
and brambles, and altogether bearing evidence of neglect and want of
culture. I went into the barn, which I found without floor or doors,
with the weather-boarding off, and was altogether in keeping with the
farm.

"While I viewed the desolation around me, and was contemplating how it
might be recovered from the curse upon it, there came rushing into the
barn a company of furious men, who commenced to pick a quarrel with me.

"The leader of the party ordered me to leave the barn and farm,
stating it was none of mine, and that I must give up all hope of ever
possessing it.

"I told him the farm was given me by the Church, and {610} although I
had not had any use of it for some time back, still I had not sold it,
and according to righteous principles it belonged to me or the Church.

"He then grew furious and began to rail upon me, and threaten me, and
said it never did belong to me nor to the Church.

"I then told him that I did not think it worth contending about, that I
had no desire to live upon it in its present state, and if he thought
he had a better right I would not quarrel with him about it but leave;
but my assurance that I would not trouble him at present did not
seem to satisfy him, as he seemed determined to quarrel with me, and
threatened me with the destruction of my body.

"While he was thus engaged, pouring out his bitter words upon me, a
rabble rushed in and nearly filled the barn, drew out their knives, and
began to quarrel among themselves for the premises, and for a moment
forgot me, at which time I took the opportunity to walk out of the barn
about up to my ankles in mud.

"When I was a little distance from the barn, I heard them screeching
and screaming in a very distressed manner, as it appeared they had
engaged in a general fight with their knives. While they were thus
engaged, the dream or vision ended."

[Sidenote: Testimony of Joseph and Hyrum to the Book of Mormon.]

Both Joseph and Hyrum bore a faithful testimony to the Latter-day
work, and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and prophesied of
the triumph of the Gospel over all the earth, exhorting the brethren
present to faithfulness and persevering diligence in proclaiming the
Gospel, building up the Temple, and performing all the duties connected
with our holy religion.

Joseph dictated the following postscript to Emma:

    _Letter: Postscript_.

    _P. S.--20 minutes to 10.--_I just learn that the Governor is
    about to disband his troops, all but a guard to protect us and the
    peace, and {611} come himself to Nauvoo and deliver a speech to the
    people. This is right as I suppose.

_He afterwards wrote a few lines with his own hand, which were not
copied_.

The letter was sent by Joel S. Mills and Cyrus H. Wheelock.

[Sidenote: Gov. Ford Warned of the Conspiracy Against Prisoner's Lives.]

John P. Greene, (Nauvoo city marshal) told Governor Ford that if he
went to Nauvoo, leaving only the Carthage Greys to guard the jail,
that there was a conspiracy on foot to take the lives of Joseph and
Hyrum Smith during his absence, to which the Governor replied, "Marshal
Greene, you are too enthusiastic."

Footnotes:

1. It is the record of the case, however, that Governor Ford did send
an order disbanding the regiment from Warsaw which he had ordered to
rendezvous at Golden's Point for the purpose of marching with the rest
of the Governor's troops into Nauvoo. "The Governor," remarks the
late John Hay, who is the authority for the incident of disbanding
the Warsaw troops--"the Governor, fearing he could not control the
inflammable material he had gathered together, had determined to
scatter it again" (_Atlantic Monthly,_ December, 1869). The courier of
the Governor to the Warsaw troops was Mr. David Matthews, a well-known
citizen of Warsaw. But after receiving the order for disbandment, while
most of the troops returned to their homes, about one hundred and fifty
volunteered to follow several of the militia captains--leaders on their
own responsibility--to Nauvoo; of whom about seventy-five reached that
place and participated in the murder of the Brothers Smith.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

DEPARTURE OF GOVERNOR FORD FOR NAUVOO--THE AFTERNOON IN CARTHAGE
PRISON--THE ASSAULT ON THE PRISON--THE MARTYRDOM OF JOSEPH AND HYRUM
SMITH.

_Thursday, June 27, [continued] 10:30.,--_Governor Ford went to
Nauvoo some time this forenoon, escorted by a portion of his troops,
most friendly to the prisoners, and leaving the known enemies of the
Prophet, ostensibly to guard the jail, having previously disbanded the
remainder.

Joseph sent a request to the Governor by Dan Jones for a pass for his
private secretary, Dr. Willard Richards.

_11 a.m.--_John S. Fullmer left the jail for Nauvoo, with a verbal
charge to assist Wheelock in gathering and forwarding witnesses for the
promised trial.

James W. Woods, Esq., Joseph's principal lawyer, left Carthage for
Nauvoo.

_11:20 a.m.--_Dan Jones returned with the following pass for Dr.
Richards:--

    _Pass for Willard Richards_.

    Permit Dr. Richards, the private secretary of Joseph Smith, to be
    with him, if he desires it, and to pass and repass the guard.

    THOMAS FORD,

    Commander-in-Chief.

    June 27th, 1844.

Jones said he could not get one for himself.

Dan Jones met Almon W. Babbitt in the street, and informed him that
Joseph wanted to see him.

{613} _11:30.--_A. W. Babbitt arrived at the jail and read a letter
from Oliver Cowdery.

Joseph, Hyrum, and Dr. Richards tried to get Jones past the guard, but
they persisted in refusing to admit him.

_12:20 noon.--_Joseph wrote for Lawyer Browning of Quincy to come up on
Saturday as his attorney, as follows:--

    _Letter: Joseph Smith to O. H. Browning--Engaging Browning as Legal
    Counsel_.

    CARTHAGE JAIL, June 27th, 1844.

    _Lawyer Browning_:--

    SIR.--Myself and brother Hyrum are in jail on charge of treason,
    to come up for examination on Saturday morning, 29th inst., and we
    request your professional services at that time, on our defense,
    without fail.

    Most respectfully, your servant,

    JOSEPH SMITH.

    P. S.--There is no cause of action, for we have not been guilty of
    any crime, neither is there any just cause of suspicion against us;
    but certain circumstances make your attendance very necessary.

    J. S.

[Sidenote: The Guard's False Alarm Over the Nauvoo Legion.]

Almon W. Babbitt took the letter and left the jail. He handed it to
Jones, with directions to take it to Quincy forthwith. The guard being
aware of the letter, told the mob that, "old Joe" had sent orders
to raise the Nauvoo Legion to come and rescue him. The mob gathered
around Jones, and demanded the letter; some of them wanted to take it
from him by force, and said that Jones should not get out of Carthage
alive, as a dozen men had started off with their rifles to waylay him
in the woods. Having previously ordered his horse, Jones took advantage
of their disagreement, and started off at full speed. He, by mistake,
took the Warsaw road, and so avoided the men who were lying in wait for
him. When he emerged on the prairie, he saw the Governor and his {614}
posse, whereupon he left the Warsaw road for the Nauvoo road.

Dr. Southwick called at the jail. Joseph gave him a note to Governor
Ford or General Deming, requesting them to furnish him with a pass.

_1:15 p.m.--_Joseph, Hyrum, and Willard dined in their room. Taylor and
Markham dined below.

[Sidenote: Markham Forced out of Carthage.]

_1:30 p.m.--_Dr. Richards was taken sick, when Joseph said, "Brother
Markham, as you have a pass from the Governor to go in and out of
the jail, go and get the doctor something that he needs to settle
his stomach," and Markham went out for medicine. When he had got
the remedies desired, and was returning to jail, a man by the name
of Stewart called out, "Old man, you have got to leave town in five
minutes." Markham replied, "I shall not do it." A company of Carthage
Greys gathered round him, put him on his horse, and forced him out of
the town at the point of the bayonet.

_3:15 p.m.--_The guard began to be more severe in their operations,
threatening among themselves, and telling what they would do when the
excitement was over.

Elder Taylor sang the following:--

  _The Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief_.

  A poor wayfaring man of grief
  Had often crossed me on my way,
  Who sued so humbly for relief
  That I could never answer, Nay.

  I had not power to ask his name;
  Whither he went or whence he came;
  Yet there was something in his eye
  That won my love, I knew not why.

  Once, when my scanty meal was spread,
  He entered--not a word he spake!
  Just perishing for want of bread;
  I gave him all; he blessed it, brake,

  And ate, but gave me part again;
  Mine was an angel's portion then,
  For while I fed with eager haste,
  The crust was manna to my taste.

  {615}
  I spied him where a fountain burst,
  Clear from the rock--his strength was gone,
  The heedless water mocked his thirst,
  He heard it, saw it hurrying on.

  I ran and raised the suff'rer up;
  Thrice from the stream he drain'd my cup,
  Dipp'd, and returned it running o'er;
  I drank and never thirsted more.

  'Twas night, the floods were out, it blew
  A winter hurricane aloof;
  I heard his voice, abroad, and flew
  To bid him welcome to my roof.

  I warmed, I clothed, I cheered my guest,
  I laid him on my couch to rest;
  Then made the earth my bed, and seem'd
  In Eden's garden while I dream'd.

  Stripp'd, wounded, beaten nigh to death,
  I found him by the highway side;
  I rous'd his pulse, brought back his breath,
  Revived his spirit, and supplied

  Wine, oil, refreshment--he was heal'd;
  I had myself a wound conceal'd;
  But from that hour forgot the smart,
  And peace bound up my broken heart,

  In pris'n I saw him next--condemned
  To meet a traitor's doom at morn;
  The tide of lying tongues I stemmed.
  And honored him 'mid shame and scorn.

  My friendship's utmost zeal to try,
  He asked, if I for him would die;
  The flesh was weak, my blood ran chill,
  But the free spirit cried, "I will!"

  Then in a moment to my view,
  The stranger started from disguise:
  The tokens in his hands I knew,
  The Savior stood before mine eyes.

  He spake--and my poor name he named--
  "Of me thou hast not been asham'd;
  These deeds shall thy memorial be;
  Fear not thou didst them unto me."

When he got through, Joseph requested him to sing it again, which he
did.

Hyrum read extracts from Josephus.

_4 p.m.--_The guard was again changed, only eight men being stationed
at the jail, whilst the main body of {616} the Carthage Greys were in
camp about a quarter of a mile distant, on the public square.

_4:15 p.m.--_Joseph commenced conversing with the guard about Joseph H.
Jackson, William and Wilson Law, and others of his persecutors.

Hyrum and Dr. Richards conversed together until quarter past five.

_5 p.m.--_Jailor Stigall returned to the jail, and said that Stephen
Markham had been surrounded by a mob, who had driven him out of
Carthage, and he had gone to Nauvoo.

[Sidenote: Anxiety of the Jailor.]

Stigall suggested that they would be safer in the cell. Joseph said,
"After supper we will go in." Mr. Stigall went out, and Joseph said to
Dr. Richards, "If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?" The
doctor answered, "Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river
with you--you did not ask me to come to Carthage--you did not ask me to
come to jail with you--and do you think I would forsake you now? But
I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for
treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free." Joseph
said "You cannot." The doctor replied, "I will."

[Sidenote: Wine for the Guard.]

Before the jailor came in, his boy brought in some water, and said the
guard wanted some wine. Joseph gave Dr. Richards two dollars to give
the guard; but the guard said one was enough, and would take no more.

The guard immediately sent for a bottle of wine, pipes, and two small
papers of tobacco; and one of the guards brought them into the jail
soon after the jailor went out. Dr. Richards uncorked the bottle, and
presented a glass to Joseph, who tasted, as also Brother Taylor and
the doctor, and the bottle was then given to the guard, who turned to
go out. When at the top of the stairs some one below called him two or
three times, and he went down.

[Sidenote: The Assault on the Jail.]

{617} Immediately there was a little rustling at the outer door of the
jail, and a cry of surrender, and also a discharge of three or four
firearms followed instantly. The doctor glanced an eye by the curtain
of the window, and saw about a hundred armed men around the door.

It is said that the guard elevated their firelocks, and boisterously
threatening the mob discharged their firearms over their heads. The mob
encircled the building, and some of them rushed by the guard up the
flight of stairs, burst open the door, and began the work of death,
while others fired in through the open windows.

[Sidenote: The Prisoner's Defense.]

In the meantime Joseph, Hyrum, and Elder Taylor had their coats off.
Joseph sprang to his coat for his six-shooter, Hyrum for his single
barrel, Taylor for Markham's large hickory cane, and Dr. Richards for
Taylor's cane. All sprang against the door, the balls whistled up the
stairway, and in an instant one came through the door.

Joseph Smith, John Taylor and Dr. Richards sprang to the left of the
door, and tried to knock aside the guns of the ruffians.

[Sidenote: Death of Hyrum Smith.]

Hyrum was retreating back in front of the door and snapped his pistol,
when a ball struck him in the left side of his nose, and he fell on
his back on the floor saying, "I am a dead man!" As he fell on the
floor another ball from the outside entered his left side, and passed
through his body with such force that it completely broke to pieces the
watch he wore in his vest pocket, and at the same instant another ball
from the door grazed his breast, and entered his head by the throat;
subsequently a fourth ball entered his left leg.

A shower of balls was pouring through all parts of the room, many of
which lodged in the ceiling just above the head of Hyrum.

[Sidenote: The "Handsome Fight" of Joseph Smith and John Taylor.]

{618} Joseph reached round the door casing, and discharged his six
shooter into the passage, some barrels missing fire. Continual
discharges of musketry came into the room. Elder Taylor continued
parrying the guns until they had got them about half their length into
the room, when he found that resistance was vain, and he attempted to
jump out of the window, where a ball fired from within struck him on
his left thigh, hitting the bone, and passing through to within half an
inch of the other side. He fell on the window sill, when a ball fired
from the outside struck his watch in his vest pocket, and threw him
back into the room.

[Sidenote: Taylor Wounded and Helpless.]

After he fell into the room he was hit by two more balls, one of them
injuring his left wrist considerably, and the other entering at the
side of the bone just below the left knee. He rolled under the bed,
which was at the right of the window in the south-east corner of the
room.

While he lay under the bed he was fired at several times from the
stairway; one ball struck him on the left hip, which tore the flesh in
a shocking manner, and large quantities of blood were scattered upon
the wall and floor.

When Hyrum fell, Joseph exclaimed, "Oh dear, brother Hyrum!" and
opening the door a few inches he discharged his six shooter in the
stairway (as stated before), two or three barrels of which missed fire.

[Sidenote: The Death of the Prophet.]

Joseph, seeing there was no safety in the room, and no doubt thinking
that it would save the lives of his brethren in the room if he could
get out, turned calmly from the door, dropped his pistol on the floor
and sprang into the window when two balls pierced him from the door,
and one entered his right breast from without, and he fell outward into
the hands of his murderers, exclaiming. "O Lord, my God!"

[Sidenote: Willard Richard's Remarkable Escape.]

{619} Dr. Richards' escape was miraculous; he being a very large man,
and in the midst of a shower of balls, yet he stood unscathed, with
the exception of a ball which grazed the tip end of the lower part of
his left ear. His escape fulfilled literally a prophecy which Joseph
made over a year previously, that the time would come that the balls
would fly around him like hail, and he should see his friends fall on
the right and on the left, but that there should not be a hole in his
garment.

The following is copied from the_ Times and Seasons_:--

    TWO MINUTES IN JAIL.

    Possibly the following events occupied near three minutes, but I
    think only about two, and have penned them for the gratification of
    many friends.

    CARTHAGE, June 27, 1844.

    A shower of musket balls were thrown up the stairway against the
    door of the prison in the second story, followed by many rapid
    footsteps.

    While Generals Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Mr. Taylor, and myself, who
    were in the front chamber, closed the door of our room against the
    entry at the head of the stairs, and placed ourselves against it,
    there being no lock on the door, and no catch that was usable.

    The door is a common panel, and as soon as we heard the feet at the
    stairs head, a ball was sent through the door, which passed between
    us, and showed that our enemies were desperadoes, and we must
    change our position.

    General Joseph Smith, Mr. Taylor and myself sprang back to
    the front part of the room, and General Hyrum Smith retreated
    two-thirds across the chamber directly in front of and facing the
    door.

    A ball was sent through the door which hit Hyrum on the side of his
    nose, when he fell backwards, extended at length, without moving
    his feet.

    From the holes in his vest (the day was warm, and no one had his
    coat on but myself), pantaloons, drawers, and shirt, it appears
    evident that a ball must have been thrown from without, through
    the window, {620} which entered his back on the right side, and
    passing through, lodged against his watch, which was in his right
    vest pocket, completely pulverizing the crystal and face, tearing
    off the hands and mashing the whole body of the watch. At the same
    instant the ball from the door entered his nose.

    As he struck the floor he exclaimed emphatically, "I am a dead
    man." Joseph looked towards him and responded, "Oh, dear brother
    Hyrum!" and opening the door two or three inches with his left
    hand, discharged one barrel of a six shooter (pistol) at random in
    the entry, from whence a ball grazed Hyrum's breast, and entering
    his throat passed into his head, while other muskets were aimed at
    him and some balls hit him.

    Joseph continued snapping his revolver round the casing of the door
    into the space as before, three barrels of which missed fire, while
    Mr. Taylor with a walking stick stood by his side and knocked down
    the bayonets and muskets which were constantly discharging through
    the doorway, while I stood by him, ready to lend any assistance,
    with another stick, but could not come within striking distance
    without going directly before the muzzle of the guns.

    When the revolver failed, we had no more firearms, and expected an
    immediate rush of the mob, and the doorway full of muskets, half
    way in the room, and no hope but instant death from within.

    Mr. Taylor rushed into the window, which is some fifteen or twenty
    feet from the ground. When his body was nearly on a balance, a
    ball from the door within entered his leg, and a ball from without
    struck his watch, a patent lever, in his vest pocket near the left
    breast, and smashed it into "pie," leaving the hands standing at 5
    o'clock, 16 minutes, and 26 seconds, the force of which ball threw
    him back on the floor, and he rolled under the bed which stood by
    his side, where he lay motionless, the mob from the door continuing
    to fire upon him, cutting away a piece of flesh from his left hip
    as large as a man's hand, and were hindered only by my knocking
    down their muzzles with a stick; while they continued to reach
    their guns into the room, probably left handed, and aimed their
    discharge so far round as almost to reach us in the corner of the
    room to where we retreated and dodged, and then I recommenced the
    attack with my stick.

    Joseph attempted, as the last resort, to leap the same window from
    whence Mr. Taylor fell, when two balls pierced him from the door,
    and one entered his right breast from without, and he fell outward,
    exclaiming, "Oh Lord, my God!" As his feet went out of the window
    my head went in, the balls whistling all around. He fell on his
    left side a dead man.

    {621} At this instant the cry was raised. "He's leaped the window!"
    and the mob on the stairs and in the entry ran out.

    I withdrew from the window, thinking it of no use to leap out on a
    hundred bayonets, then around General Joseph Smith's body.

    Not satisfied with this I again reached my head out of the window,
    and watched some seconds to see if there were any signs of life,
    regardless of my own, determined to see the end of him I loved.
    Being fully satisfied that he was dead, with a hundred men near the
    body and more coming round the corner of the jail, and expecting a
    return to our room, I rushed towards the prison door, at the head
    of the stairs, and through the entry from whence the firing had
    proceeded, to learn if the doors into the prison were open.

    When near the entry, Mr. Taylor called out, "Take me." I pressed my
    way until I found all doors unbarred, returning instantly, caught
    Mr. Taylor under my arm and rushed by the stairs into the dungeon,
    or inner prison, stretched him on the floor and covered him with a
    bed in such a manner as not likely to be perceived, expecting an
    immediate return of the mob.

    I said to Mr. Taylor, "This is a hard case to lay you on the floor,
    but if your wounds are not fatal, I want you to live to tell the
    story." I expected to be shot the next moment, and stood before the
    door awaiting the onset.

    WILLARD RICHARDS.

While Willard Richards and John Taylor were in the cell, a company
of the mob again rushed up stairs, but finding only the dead body
of Hyrum, they were again descending the stairs, when a loud cry
was heard, "The Mormons are coming!" which caused the whole band of
murderers to flee precipitately to the woods.

The following communication was written and sent to Nauvoo:--

    _First Message to Nauvoo_.

    CARTHAGE JAIL, 8:05 o'clock, p.m., June 27th, 1844.

    Joseph and Hyrum are dead. Taylor wounded, not very badly. [1] I am
    well. Our guard was forced, as we believe, by a band of Missourians
    {622} from 100 to 200. The job was done in an instant, and the
    party fled towards Nauvoo instantly. This is as I believe it. The
    citizens here are afraid of the Mormons attacking them. I promise
    them no!

    W. RICHARDS,

    JOHN TAYLOR.

    N. B.--The citizens promise us protection. Alarm guns have been
    fired.

The above note was addressed to Governor Ford, Gen. Dunham, Col.
Markham, Emma Smith, Nauvoo.

This letter was given to William and John Barnes, two mobocrats, who
were afraid to go to Nauvoo, fearing that the Mormons would kill them
and lay everything waste about Carthage; they therefore carried it
to Arza Adams, who was sick with the ague and fever, about two and a
half miles north of Carthage. He was afraid to go on the main road;
and after two hours persuasion Mr. Benjamin Leyland consented to
pilot Adams by "a blind road," and about midnight they started, and
arrived in Nauvoo a little after sunrise. They found the news had
arrived before them, for about a dozen men were talking about it at
the Mansion, but not knowing what to believe until Adams handed in the
above official letter.

Footnotes:

1. This statement was made at Elder Taylor's request, that he might not
alarm his family he was, however, severely wounded, as the narrative in
the text bears witness. When the note above was being prepared, Elder
Taylor said, "Brother Richards, say I am _slightly_ wounded;" and when
it was brought to him he signed his name as quickly as he could, lest
the tremor of his hand should be noticed and the fears of his family
aroused (_The Life of John Taylor,_ pp. 144-5).

CHAPTER XXXIV.

GOVERNOR FORD IN NAUVOO--NEWS OF THE MARTYRDOM--MESSAGES TO
NAUVOO--ARRIVAL OF THE BODIES--SORROWFUL SCENES--THE BURIAL.

[Sidenote: Governor Ford in Nauvoo.]

_Thursday, June 27th (continued).--_In the meantime the Governor was
making to the Saints in Nauvoo one of the most infamous and insulting
speeches that ever fell from the lips of an executive. Among other
things he said, "A great crime has been done by destroying the
_Expositor_ press and placing the city under martial law, and a severe
atonement must be made, so prepare your minds for the emergency.
Another cause of excitement is the fact of your having so many
firearms. The public are afraid that you are going to use them against
government. I know there is a great prejudice against you on account
of your peculiar religion, but you ought to be praying Saints, not
military Saints. Depend upon it, a little more misbehavior from the
citizens, and the torch, which is already lighted, will be applied, and
the city may be reduced to ashes, and extermination would inevitably
follow; and it gives me great pain to think that there is danger of so
many innocent women and children being exterminated. If anything of a
serious character should befall the lives or property of the persons
who are prosecuting your leaders, you will be held responsible."

[Sidenote: Military Display.]

The Governor was solicited to stay until morning, but he declined,
and left Nauvoo at about 6:30 p.m.; and in passing up Main Street his
escort performed the sword exercise, giving all the passes, guards,
cuts and thrusts, taking up the entire width of {624} the street, and
making as imposing a show as they could, until they passed Lyon's
store, near the Masonic Hall. This was apparently done to intimidate
the people, as the Governor had remarked in his speech that they need
not expect to set themselves up against such "well disciplined troops."

Soon after Captain Singleton and his company left for home.

[Sidenote: Gov. Ford's Interception of Grant ant Bettisworth.]

When the Governor and his party had proceeded about three miles from
Nauvoo, they met two messengers (George D. Grant and David Bettisworth)
hastening with the sad news to Nauvoo. The Governor took them back to
Grant's house, one and one-half miles east of Carthage, with him in
order to prevent their carrying the news until he and the authorities
had removed the county records and public documents, and until most of
the inhabitants had left Carthage. The Governor then proceeded towards
Carthage, when Grant took another horse and rode into Nauvoo with the
news that night.

    _Second Message to Nauvoo_.

    12 o'clock at night, 27th June,

    CARTHAGE, HAMILTON'S TAVERN.

    _To Mrs. Emma Smith and Major General Dunham, &c_.:

    The Governor has just arrived; says all things shall be inquired
    into, and all right measures taken.

    I say to all the citizens of Nauvoo, my brethren, be still, and
    know that _God reigns. Don't rush out of the city_--don't rush to
    Carthage--stay at home, and be prepared for an attack from Missouri
    mobbers. The Governor will render every assistance possible--has
    sent out orders for troops. Joseph and Hyrum are dead. We will
    prepare to move the bodies as soon as possible.

    The people of the county are greatly excited, and fear the Mormons
    will come out and take vengeance. I have pledged my word the
    Mormons will stay at home as soon as they can be informed, and no
    violence will be on their part, and say to my brethren in Nauvoo,
    in the {625} name of the Lord, be still, be patient, only let such
    friends as choose come here to see the bodies. Mr. Taylor's wounds
    are dressed and not serious. I am sound.

    WILLARD RICHARDS,

    JOHN TAYLOR,

    SAMUEL H. SMITH.

    Defend yourselves until protection can be furnished necessary. June
    27th, 1844.

    THOMAS FORD,

    Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

    _Mr. Orson Spencer_:

    DEAR SIR:--Please deliberate on this matter--prudence may obviate
    material destruction. I was at my residence when this horrible
    crime was committed. It will be condemned by three-fourths of the
    citizens of the county. Be quiet, or you will be attacked from
    Missouri.

    M. R. DEMING.

It was near midnight before Dr. Richards could obtain any help or
refreshment for John Taylor, who was badly wounded, nearly all the
inhabitants of Carthage having fled in terror.

[Sidenote: Departure of the Governor from the Danger Zone.]

_Friday, 28.--1 a.m._ The Governor said the matter should be
investigated, and that there was a great responsibility resting upon
him. He also said he would send a messenger with an express for Dr.
Richards, and wrote an order for the citizens of Nauvoo to defend
themselves.

He then went to the public square, and advised all who were present
to disperse, as he expected the Mormons would be so exasperated that
they would come and burn the town, whereupon the citizens of Carthage
fled in all directions, and the Governor and his _posse_ fled towards
Quincy, and did not consider themselves safe until they had reached
Augusta, eighteen miles distant from Carthage.

Captain Singleton, of Brown county arrived in Carthage from Nauvoo with
his troops.

[Sidenote: The Start for Nauvoo with the Bodies of the Martyrs.]

{626} About 8 a.m. Dr. Richards started for Nauvoo with the bodies of
Joseph and Hyrum on two wagons, accompanied by their brother Samuel
M. Smith, Mr. Hamilton, and a guard of eight soldiers who had been
detached for that purpose by General Deming. The bodies were covered
with bushes to keep them from the hot sun. They were met by a great
assemblage of citizens of Nauvoo, on Mulholland Street, about a mile
east of the Temple, about three p.m. under direction of the city
marshal.

The City Council, the Lieut.-General's staff, Major. General Jonathan
Dunham and staff, the acting Brigadier-General Hosea Stout and staff,
commanders and officers of the Legion, and several thousands of the
citizens were there amid the most solemn lamentations and wailings that
ever ascended into the ears of the Lord of Hosts to be avenged of their
enemies.

When the procession arrived, the bodies were both taken into the Nauvoo
Mansion. The scene there cannot be described.

[Sidenote: The Address of Dr. Richards _et. al_.]

About eight or ten thousand persons were addressed by Dr. Willard
Richards, William W. Phelps, Esquires Woods and Reid of Iowa, and Col.
Stephen Markham. Dr. Richards admonished the people to keep the peace,
stating that he had pledged his honor, and his life for their good
conduct, when the people with one united voice resolved to trust to the
law for a remedy of such a high-handed assassination, and when that
failed, to call upon God to avenge them of their wrongs.

O, Americans, weep, for the glory of freedom has departed!

When the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum arrived at the Mansion, the doors
were closed immediately. The people were told to go quietly home, and
the bodies would be viewed the next morning at eight o'clock.

{627}

[Sidenote: Preparation of the Bodies for Burial.]

Dimick B. Huntington, with the assistance of William Marks and William
D. Huntington, washed the bodies from head to foot. Joseph was shot in
the right breast, also under the heart, in the lower part of his bowels
and the right side, and on the back part of the right hip. One ball had
come out at the right shoulder-blade. Cotton soaked in camphor was put
into each wound, and the bodies laid out with fine plain drawers and
shirt, white neckerchiefs, white cotton stockings and white shrouds.
(Gilbert Goldsmith was doorkeeper at the time).

After this was done, Emma (who at the time was pregnant) also Mary
(Hyrum's wife) with the children of the martyred Prophet and Patriarch,
were admitted to see the bodies. On first seeing the corpse of her
husband, Emma screamed and fell back, but was caught and supported
by Dimick B. Huntington. She then fell forward to the Prophet's face
and kissed him, calling him by name, and begged him to speak to her
once. Mary, (the Patriarch's wife) manifested calmness and composure
throughout the trying scene, which was affecting in the extreme.
Relatives and particular friends were also permitted to view the
remains during the evening.

_Saturday 29.--_At 7 a.m. the bodies were put into the coffins which
were covered with black velvet fastened with brass nails. Over the
face of each corpse a lid was hung with brass hinges, under which was
a square of glass to protect the face, and the coffin was lined with
white cambric. The coffins were then each put into a rough pine box.

[Sidenote: Lying in State.]

At 8 a.m. the room was thrown open for the Saints to view the bodies of
their martyred Prophet and Patriarch, and it is estimated that over ten
thousand persons visited the remains that day, as there was a perfect
living stream of people entering in at the west door of the Mansion and
out at the north door from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., at which hour a request
was made {628} that the Mansion should be cleared, so that the family
could take their farewell look at the remains.

The coffins were then taken out of the boxes into the little bedroom in
the northeast corner of the Mansion, and there concealed and the doors
locked. Bags of sand were then placed in each end of the boxes, which
were nailed up, and a mock funeral took place, the boxes being put into
a hearse and driven to the graveyard by William D. Huntington, and
there deposited in a grave with the usual ceremonies.

This was done to prevent enemies of the martyred Prophet and Patriarch
getting possession of the bodies, as they threatened they would do. As
the hearse passed the meeting ground accompanied by a few men, William
W. Phelps was preaching the funeral sermon.

[Sidenote: The Real Burial.]

About midnight the coffins containing the bodies were taken from the
Mansion by Dimick B. Huntington, Edward Hunter, William D. Huntington,
William Marks, Jonathan H. Holmes, Gilbert Goldsmith, Alpheus Cutler,
Lorenzo D. Wasson, and Philip B. Lewis, preceded by James Emmett as
guard with his musket.

They went through the garden, round by the pump, and were conveyed
to the Nauvoo house, which was then built to the first joists of the
basement, and buried in the basement story.

After the bodies were interred, and the ground smoothed off as it was
before, and chips of wood and stone and other rubbish thrown over, so
as to make it appear like the rest of the ground around the graves, a
most terrific shower of rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning,
occurred, and obliterated all traces of the fact that the earth had
been newly dug.

The bodies remained in the cellar of the Nauvoo House where they were
buried, until the fall, when they were removed by Dimick B. Huntington,
William D. Huntington, Jonathan H. Holmes, and Gilbert Goldsmith, at
Emma's request, to near the Mansion, and buried side by {629} side, and
the bee house then moved and placed over their graves.

The deceased children of Joseph were afterwards removed and interred in
the same place. It was found at this time that two of Hyrum's teeth had
fallen into the inside of his mouth, supposed to have been done by a
ball at the time of the martyrdom, but which was not discovered at the
time he was laid out, in consequence of his jaws being tied up. * * * *

[It is thought proper that this volume, which brings the HISTORY OF
THE CHURCH to close of its first Period--the administration of its
First President, and, by way of pre-eminence _the_ Prophet of the New
Dispensation of the Gospel, should close with the official statement of
the Martyrdom of the Prophet and the Patriarch. A statement so true,
and conservative, and excellent that now for a long time it has been
published in the "Doctrine and Covenants."]

    MARTYRDOM OF JOSEPH SMITH, THE PROPHET, AND HIS BROTHER HYRUM.

    _(From the Doctrine and Covenants)_.

    To seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we
    announce the Martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum
    Smith the Patriarch. They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th
    of June, 1844, about 5 o'clock p.m., by an armed mob, painted
    black--of from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first and fell
    calmly, exclaiming,_ "I am a dead man!"_ Joseph leaped from the
    window and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming, _"O Lord, my
    God!"_ They were both shot after they were dead in a brutal manner,
    and both received four balls.

    John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only
    persons in the room at the time; the former was wounded in a savage
    manner with four balls, but has since recovered; the latter through
    the providence of God, escaped, "without even a hole in his robe."

    Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more (save
    Jesus only) for the salvation of men in this world, than any {630}
    other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years
    he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by
    the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing
    it on two continents; has sent the fullness of the everlasting
    Gospel which it contained to the four quarters of the earth; has
    brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this
    Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and
    instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many
    thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city; and left
    a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died
    great in the eyes of God and his people, and like most of the
    Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his
    works with his own blood--and so has his brother Hyrum. In life
    they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!

    When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended
    requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his
    assassination, he said:

    _"I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a
    summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense toward God
    and towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said
    of me--he was murdered in cold blood_."

    The same morning after Hyrum had made ready to go--shall it be
    said to the slaughter? Yes, for so it was,--he read the following
    paragraph near the close of the fifth chapter of Ether, in the Book
    of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it:

    _"And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that He would
    give unto the Gentiles grace that they might have charity. And it
    came to pass that the Lord said unto me, if they have not charity,
    it mattereth not unto you, thou hast been faithful: wherefore thy
    garments are clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness thou
    shall be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which
    I have prepared in the mansions of my Father. And now I . . . bid
    farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, and also unto my brethren whom I
    love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ where
    all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your
    blood_."

    The testators are now dead, and their testament is in force.

    Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old, February, 1844, and Joseph
    Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843: and henceforward their
    names will be classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader
    in every nation will be reminded that the Book of Mormon and this
    Book of Doctrine and Covenants of the Church, cost the best blood
    of the nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation
    of a ruined world; and that if the fire can scathe a _green tree_
    for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the "dry trees" to
    purify the vineyard of corruption. {631} They lived for glory, they
    died for glory; and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age
    shall their names go down to posterity as gems for the sanctified.

    They were innocent of any crime, as they had often been proved
    before, and were only confined in the jail by the conspiracy of
    traitors and wicked men; and their innocent blood on the floor of
    Carthage jail, is a broad seal affixed to "Mormonism" that cannot
    be rejected by any court on earth; and their_ innocent blood_ on
    the escutcheon of the State of Illinois with the broken faith of
    the State, as pledged by the Governor, is a witness to the truth
    of the everlasting gospel, that all the world cannot impeach; and
    their _innocent blood_ on the banner of liberty, and on the _magna
    charta_ of the United States is an ambassador for the religion of
    Jesus Christ that will touch the heart of honest men among all
    nations; and their_ innocent blood_ with _the innocent blood_ of
    all the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the
    Lord of Hosts, till He avenges that blood on the earth. Amen.
